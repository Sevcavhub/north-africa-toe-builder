   - Based on British War Office supply records and Eighth Army distribution patterns
   - War diary coverage for Free French units in Q1 1943 incomplete

3. **Personnel strength precision** - Based on British brigade organization models
   - Free French unit returns used where available
   - Estimates cross-referenced against multiple sources
