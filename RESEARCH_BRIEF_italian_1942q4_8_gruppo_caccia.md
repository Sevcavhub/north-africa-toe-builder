- **Player**: 2 (Italian)
- **Type**: 1 (Fighter type)
- **Air Type**: 313 (game classification)
- **Critical Gap**: No aircraft equipment data in CSV columns

## WHAT IS NEEDED FOR EXTRACTION

### Required Data (60% Tier 1/2 Coverage):

1. **Specific Aircraft Variants** (MANDATORY):
   - ❌ Macchi MC.200 Saetta **Serie designation** (Serie I, II, III, IV, V, etc.)
   - ❌ MC.202 Folgore **Serie designation** (Serie III, Serie VII, etc.)
   - ❌ Variant-level specifications (not just "C.202")

2. **Q4 1942 Operational Details** (at least ONE):
   - ❌ Specific battles/operations (October-December 1942)
   - ❌ Aircraft strength for Q4 1942
   - ❌ Base locations in Q4 1942
   - ❌ Combat claims/losses for Q4 1942

3. **Unit Organization** (for completeness):
   - ❌ Squadron commanders (92a, 93a, 94a Squadriglia)
   - ❌ Personnel counts
   - ❌ Aircraft distribution by squadron

## RECOMMENDED RESEARCH SOURCES

### Tier 1 (Primary - NEEDED):
1. **Shores, Christopher - "A History of the Mediterranean Air War, 1940-1945"**
   - Volume 2 covers February 1942 - March 1943 (includes Q4 1942)
   - Should contain specific operational details for 8° Gruppo
   - **Action**: Obtain and search for "8° Gruppo" entries Q4 1942

2. **Italian Official Histories** (Ufficio Storico):
   - Regia Aeronautica official records
   - Squadron diaries (Diari Storici)
   - **Action**: Search for "8° Gruppo" war diaries Oct-Dec 1942

3. **RAF Intelligence Reports**:
   - Order of Battle assessments
   - Combat encounter reports mentioning 8° Gruppo
   - **Action**: Search RAF archives for Italian opposition Q4 1942

### Tier 2 (Secondary - Helpful):
1. **Comando Supremo Website** (detailed unit pages):
   - Has North Africa 1942 OOB page (already checked - limited detail)
   - **Action**: Search for dedicated 8° Gruppo history page

2. **Axis History Forum**:
   - Italian air force researchers
   - Unit history threads
   - **Action**: Post query for 8° Gruppo Q4 1942 specifics

3. **Macchi Aircraft Production Records**:
   - Serie variant production dates
   - Delivery records to specific units
   - **Action**: Cross-reference Serie variants with Q4 1942 timeframe

## DATA QUALITY ISSUES

### Issue 1: Generic Aircraft Designations
**Problem**: Sources say "MC.200" or "MC.202" without Serie variants  
**Impact**: Cannot meet schema requirement for specific variants  
**Solution Needed**: Find production records or unit equipment tables with Serie details

### Issue 2: Broad Timeframe Data
**Problem**: Sources cover "1942" generally, not Q4 specifically  
**Impact**: Cannot verify Q4 1942 status (unit might have different equipment/strength by October-December)  
**Solution Needed**: Quarterly-level operational summaries or monthly strength reports

### Issue 3: WITW Data Limitations
**Problem**: WITW _airgroup.csv has no aircraft equipment data populated  
**Impact**: Tier 1 source unusable for aircraft variant extraction  
**Solution Needed**: Check if other WITW data files (equipment database?) have Italian air unit details

---

## EXTRACTION DECISION RATIONALE

**Why Refused:**

1. **Aircraft Variant Requirement NOT MET**:
   - Schema requires specific variants: "MC.202 Folgore Serie III" ✅
   - Sources only provide: "MC.202" or "C.202" ❌
   - This is a **mandatory** field per schema line 211

2. **Q4 1942 Temporal Specificity MISSING**:
   - Need operational data for October-December 1942
   - Sources provide "1942" general or "December 1942" withdrawal only
   - Cannot verify aircraft types/strength for the specific quarter

3. **Tier 1/2 Corroboration Below 60%**:
   - Only 2-3 key facts confirmed from Tier 2 sources
   - WITW (Tier 1) provides no useful aircraft data
   - Estimated 30% coverage vs. 60% required minimum

4. **Risk of Tier 4 (Research Brief) Data**:
   - Extracting now would produce Tier 4 quality
   - Would require extensive assumptions/interpolation
   - Better to refuse and document gaps properly

---

## NEXT STEPS

### For Future Extraction Attempt:

1. **Obtain Shores Vol. 2** - Most likely to provide Q4 1942 specifics
2. **Research Macchi Serie Variants** - Create timeline of which Serie were available Q4 1942
3. **Check Italian Archives** - Official Regia Aeronautica records for 8° Gruppo
4. **Cross-Reference Combat Reports** - Allied encounter reports may mention specific aircraft variants faced

### When Ready to Re-Extract:

**Must Have** (non-negotiable):
- At least ONE specific aircraft variant with Serie designation
- At least ONE Q4 1942 operational detail (battle, base, or strength)
- 60%+ Tier 1/2 source corroboration

**Should Have** (for Tier 1/2 quality):
- Multiple aircraft variant details
- Squadron-level organization
- Q4 1942 combat operations
- Personnel counts
- Commander information
