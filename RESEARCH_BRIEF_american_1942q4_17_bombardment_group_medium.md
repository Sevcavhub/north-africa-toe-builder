# RESEARCH BRIEF: 17th Bombardment Group (Medium) - 1942-Q4

**Status**: EXTRACTION REFUSED - Insufficient Variant Specificity  
**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Reason**: Cannot meet Hybrid Source Validation Protocol requirement for specific aircraft variant identification

---

## Extraction Attempt Summary

### Requirements (Per Hybrid Source Validation Protocol)
- ✅ Wikipedia for identification ONLY
- ✅ Tier 1/2 sources REQUIRED for extraction (60% minimum)
- ✅ Must have 3+ key facts from Tier 1/2
- ❌ **At least ONE specific aircraft variant** (e.g., "B-26B-1" NOT just "B-26 Marauder")

### What Was Found

**✅ CONFIRMED DATA (5 key facts from Tier 1/2 sources):**

1. **Unit Designation**: 17th Bombardment Group (Medium)
   - Source: WITW _airgroup.csv (Tier 1) - Row 1852: "17th USAAF LB Grp"
   - Source: Multiple Tier 2 (armyaircorpsmuseum.org, b26.com, historyofwar.org)

2. **Squadron Composition**:
   - 34th Bombardment Squadron
   - 37th Bombardment Squadron
   - 95th Bombardment Squadron
   - 432d Bombardment Squadron
   - Source: 17thbg.org (official unit reunion site), Wikipedia cross-referenced

3. **Deployment Timeline**:
   - Training: Barksdale Field, Louisiana (June-November 1942)
   - Conversion to B-26 Marauders: Summer 1942
   - Deployment: Telergma, Algeria (December 1942)
   - First combat: December 30, 1942
   - Source: armyaircorpsmuseum.org, b26.com, historyofwar.org

4. **First Combat Mission**:
   - Date: December 30, 1942
   - Target: German airfield at Gabes, Tunisia
   - Aircraft: 6x B-26s
   - Result: First loss on December 31, 1942 (second raid on same target)
   - Source: Multiple (historyofwar.org, armyaircorpsmuseum.org, b26.com)

5. **Organizational Assignment**:
   - Parent: XII Bomber Command, Twelfth Air Force
   - Theater: North Africa Campaign (Operation Torch)
   - Base: Telergma Airport, Algeria (December 1942 - May 1943)
   - Source: Wikipedia (XII Bomber Command), Telergma Airport article

**❌ MISSING - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**

**Aircraft Variant Specificity**: 
- Found: Generic "B-26 Marauder" references
- Found: B-26B serial numbers (41-17839, 41-17715) from 17th BG units
- Found: B-26B entered service May 1942
- Found: B-26C entered service "end of 1942 in North Africa"
- Found: 34th BS flew "first mission in mid-November 1942" (contradicts Dec 30 date - needs clarification)
- **NOT FOUND**: Explicit confirmation of B-26 variant/block for Q4 1942 deployment
  - Was it B-26A? B-26B-1? B-26B-2? B-26B-10? B-26C?
  - Were multiple variants present?
  - When did variant transitions occur?

### B-26 Variant Timeline Context

**What We Know About B-26 Production:**
- **B-26A**: 139 produced, entered service October 1941, 52 sent to RAF as Marauder I
- **B-26B**: Entered service May 1942, R-2800-41/43 engines (2,000 HP), definitive variant
- **B-26C**: 1,210-1,235 produced at Omaha plant, entered service "end of 1942 in North Africa", increased defensive armament

**Problem**: The 17th BG converted to B-26s in "summer 1942" and deployed December 1942. This timing suggests:
- Possible: Early B-26B models (May-December 1942 production)
- Possible: Late B-26A models (if received before B-26B availability)
- Possible: Early B-26C models (if "end of 1942" delivery caught deployment)
- Likely: Mix of B-26B blocks due to 6-month training window

**No source explicitly confirms the variant/block used in Q4 1942.**

## Tier Assessment

**If extraction had proceeded with available data:**
- **Tier Achieved**: Likely Tier 3 (Partial - 50-59%)
- **Tier 1/2 Corroboration**: ~60% (5 key facts confirmed, 1 critical fact missing)

**Reasoning**:
- Strong organizational data (unit, squadrons, command structure)
- Strong operational data (dates, bases, missions)
- Weak technical data (no variant specificity)
- Would require significant research to achieve Tier 2 (60-74%)

## Required Research to Enable Extraction

### Primary Sources Needed (Tier 1):

1. **Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA)**
   - URL: https://www.dafhistory.af.mil/
   - Need: 17th Bombardment Group Unit History (December 1942)
   - Expected Content: Aircraft inventory by variant, squadron assignments
   - Access: Requires direct contact or on-site research

2. **USAAF Combat Mission Reports**
   - December 30, 1942 - Gabes mission
   - December 31, 1942 - Second Gabes mission
   - Expected Content: Aircraft serial numbers, variant details, crew assignments
   - Location: National Archives or AFHRA

3. **XII Bomber Command Records**
   - December 1942 organizational documents
   - Equipment allocation tables
   - Expected Content: B-26 variant distribution to groups

### Secondary Sources Needed (Tier 2):

1. **17th Bombardment Group Official History**
   - PDF at usafunithistory.com was corrupted/unreadable
   - Alternative sources needed

2. **B-26 Marauder Serial Number Databases**
   - Cross-reference known 17th BG serials (41-17839, 41-17715)
   - Determine variant from serial number blocks
   - Sources: b26.com archives, Joe Baugher serial number database

3. **Asisbiz.com B-26 Pages**
   - Check for 17th BG aircraft profiles with variants
   - Cross-reference squadron assignments

4. **Squadron Histories**
   - 34th, 37th, 95th, 432d Bomb Squadron official histories
   - Check for variant mentions in December 1942 entries

## Discrepancy to Resolve

**Conflicting First Mission Dates:**
- Most sources: December 30, 1942 (Gabes attack)
- One source: "Mid-November 1942" (34th BS from Telergma)

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Confusion with 319th Bombardment Group (arrived Telergma Dec 12, 1942)
2. Training/familiarization flights in November vs. combat debut in December
3. Individual squadron vs. group-level operations
4. Source error

**Resolution Needed**: Clarify actual first combat date with Tier 1 sources.

## Extraction Path Forward

### Option 1: Partial Extraction (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Extract with "B-26 Marauder (variant unknown)" notation
- Mark aircraft section as Tier 4 (research brief level)
- Risk: Violates protocol requirement for variant specificity

### Option 2: Research First (RECOMMENDED)
- Contact AFHRA for December 1942 unit records
- Check Joe Baugher serial database for 41-17839 variant confirmation
- Search NARA for XII Bomber Command equipment tables
- Re-attempt extraction when variant confirmed

### Option 3: Defer to Later Phase
- Mark unit for "Air Forces Phase 7" research
- Focus current work on units with clearer source data
- Return when primary sources accessed

---

## Conclusion

**Protocol Status**: ❌ REQUIREMENTS NOT MET  
**Bottleneck**: Lack of specific aircraft variant identification for Q4 1942  
**Tier 1/2 Corroboration**: 60% (5/6 requirements met)  
**Recommended Action**: Research via AFHRA/NARA before extraction attempt

**The 17th Bombardment Group has strong organizational and operational documentation, but lacks the technical specificity required by the Hybrid Source Validation Protocol. This unit should be deferred until primary source access can confirm B-26 variant details.**
