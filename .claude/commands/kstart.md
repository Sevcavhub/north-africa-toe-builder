‚ö†Ô∏è **THIS IS A TWO-STEP COMMAND - DO NOT AUTO-EXECUTE BOTH STEPS!** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## STEP 1: SHOW NEXT 3 UNITS (Execute immediately)

Run: Bash('npm run session:start')

This will display:
- Quarter completion dashboard
- **Next 3 units from WORK_QUEUE.md** (chronological + echelon order)
- Session counter (0/12 units this session)
- Progress summary

## STEP 2: WAIT FOR USER DECISION (DO NOT EXECUTE UNTIL USER RESPONDS!)

After showing next 3 units, OUTPUT THIS MESSAGE TO USER:

```
üìã Next 3 units from WORK_QUEUE.md:

[List the 3 units here]

Session Progress: [X]/12 units this session (max 4 batches of 3)

‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE I LAUNCH THE AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATOR, please choose:

‚Ä¢ Reply "Proceed" ‚Üí I will launch Task tool for these 3 units
‚Ä¢ Reply "Skip" ‚Üí I will skip these units and show next 3 from queue
‚Ä¢ Reply "Use [unit list]" ‚Üí I will use your custom unit selection instead

What would you like to do?
```

## STEP 3: ONLY EXECUTE AFTER USER REPLIES "Proceed"

‚ùå DO NOT execute this step until user explicitly says "Proceed"
‚ùå DO NOT assume user wants to proceed
‚ùå DO NOT launch Task tool automatically

When user says "Proceed", THEN launch Task tool:
- subagent_type='general-purpose'
- Prompt: "Run autonomous orchestration for North Africa TO&E Builder..."

## WORKFLOW (3-3-3-3 Pattern):

1. **Batch 1**: Process 3 units ‚Üí `npm run checkpoint` (auto-commit) ‚Üí Session: 3/12
2. **Batch 2**: Process 3 units ‚Üí `npm run checkpoint` (auto-commit) ‚Üí Session: 6/12
3. **Batch 3**: Process 3 units ‚Üí `npm run checkpoint` (auto-commit) ‚Üí Session: 9/12
4. **Batch 4**: Process 3 units ‚Üí `npm run checkpoint` (auto-commit) ‚Üí Session: 12/12
5. **BLOCKED**: Run `npm run session:end` to reset counter and save summary

**CHECKPOINT AUTOMATICALLY**:
- ‚úÖ Updates WORKFLOW_STATE.json
- ‚úÖ Increments session counter (+3)
- ‚úÖ Regenerates WORK_QUEUE.md
- ‚úÖ Commits to git
- ‚úÖ Pushes to GitHub

## CRITICAL RULES:
1. /kstart is NOT a single automatic command
2. /kstart means: show next 3 from WORK_QUEUE.md, THEN wait for user decision
3. User must explicitly confirm before Task tool launches
4. DO NOT perform extraction yourself - specialized agents only
5. Session limit: 12 units max (prevents AI drift/hallucination)
