description: Starts Autonomous Orchestrator.

‚ö†Ô∏è **THIS IS A TWO-STEP COMMAND - DO NOT AUTO-EXECUTE BOTH STEPS!** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## STEP 1: SHOW RECOMMENDATIONS (Execute immediately)

Run: Bash('npm run session:start')

This will display:
- Quarter completion dashboard
- 3 recommended units
- Target quarter and strategy

## STEP 2: WAIT FOR USER DECISION (DO NOT EXECUTE UNTIL USER RESPONDS!)

After showing recommendations, OUTPUT THIS MESSAGE TO USER:

```
üìã Recommended units for autonomous orchestration:

[List the 3 units here]

Target Quarter: [quarter] ([completion]% complete)

‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE I LAUNCH THE AUTONOMOUS ORCHESTRATOR, please choose:

‚Ä¢ Reply "Proceed" ‚Üí I will launch Task tool for these 3 units
‚Ä¢ Reply "Change to [strategy/quarter]" ‚Üí I will re-run session:start with different strategy
‚Ä¢ Reply "Use [unit list]" ‚Üí I will use your custom unit selection instead

What would you like to do?
```

## STEP 3: ONLY EXECUTE AFTER USER REPLIES "Proceed"

‚ùå DO NOT execute this step until user explicitly says "Proceed"
‚ùå DO NOT assume user wants to proceed
‚ùå DO NOT launch Task tool automatically

When user says "Proceed", THEN launch Task tool:
- subagent_type='general-purpose'
- Prompt: "Run autonomous orchestration for North Africa TO&E Builder..."

## CRITICAL RULES:
1. /kstart is NOT a single automatic command
2. /kstart means: show recommendations, THEN wait for user decision
3. User must explicitly confirm before Task tool launches
4. DO NOT perform extraction yourself - specialized agents only
