## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created 7 Quarterly Air Summaries
- **German**: 3 summaries (1941-Q2, 1942-Q1, Q2) - Tier 1, 90% confidence
- **Italian**: 2 summaries (1942-Q1, Q2) - Tier 3, 70-75% confidence
- **British**: 2 summaries (1942-Q2, Q3) - Tier 2, 75% confidence

**Total**: 96 air units (squadrons/gruppi) extracted

### 2. Hybrid Data Integration
Combined Nafziger organizational details + Wikipedia aggregate strength + standard establishment estimates

**Scripts Created**:
- `scripts/extract_nafziger_air_pdf.js` - Automated PDF parser
- `scripts/create_hybrid_air_summaries.js` - Merge Nafziger + Wikipedia data

### 3. Army-Level Integration
Added `air_support` sections to 5 Army/Corps JSONs:
- British 8th Army 1942-Q2 (463 aircraft, 21 squadrons)
- British 8th Army 1942-Q3 (740 aircraft, 37 squadrons)  
- German Panzerarmee Afrika 1942-Q2 (20 aircraft, 2 squadrons)
- Italian XXI Corps 1942-Q1 (400 aircraft, 22 units)
- Italian XXI Corps 1942-Q2 (412 aircraft, 5 units)

**Script**: `scripts/add_air_support_to_armies.js`

### 4. MDBook Chapter Updates
Added Air Support sections to 5 existing Army-level chapters

**Script**: `scripts/add_air_sections_to_chapters.js`

### 5. Theater Overview Chapters
Generated 4 quarterly multi-nation air comparison chapters:
- 1941-Q2: German (170 aircraft)
- 1942-Q1: German + Italian (405 aircraft)
- 1942-Q2: German + Italian + British (895 aircraft, 48% Axis vs 52% Allies)

## Decision Made

**Accepted Wikipedia-enhanced summaries** (Option A) instead of pursuing archival sources (Option B)

**Rationale**: All summaries now have functional aggregate strength data sufficient for scenario generation. Can upgrade to Tier 1 later with UK National Archives AIR 27 research (~£10-15, 3-5 hours).

## Quality Metrics

- **Success Rate**: 100% (7/7 summaries generated)
- **Tier 1**: 3 summaries (43%) - German
- **Tier 2**: 2 summaries (29%) - British  
- **Tier 3**: 2 summaries (29%) - Italian

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Commit changes to git
2. Test scenario generation integration
3. Fill coverage gaps (48 quarters remaining: 1940-Q3 to 1943-Q1)
4. Optional: Upgrade British/Italian to Tier 1 with archival research
