BATTLEGROUP •  RULES W elcome to Battlegroup, a set of  tabletop miniature wargames  rules for recreating the battles of World  War II, in any theatre, using 15mm or  20mm miniatures  . Within you will find the core rules of  game, how to move and shoot units  (in various different ways) and how  this affects a unit’s morale  .  For those  familiar with tabletop wargaming, there  is nothing unusual in this  .  This is not the  full story though  .  This is just the ‘core’  rulebook, it provides the general rules  on how to play the game  .  Alongside  this you will need one of the theatre  supplements  .  Each supplement deals  with an individual theatre or period  of the war in detail, providing gamers  with its own unique character and feel  .   Playing just these basic rules is possible,  but will result in a rather bland and  generic battle, which did not really try to  recreate the character of any particular  theatre  .  The war fought on the Eastern  Front, say in Stalingrad in 1942, had a  very different character than that fought  in France in 1940, or again 1944, or on  the islands of the Pacific in 1945. The  theatre supplements are where you will  find this detail. This book does not include any of the  army lists (it does include how to use  them though), scenarios, campaigns  or special rules particular to a theatre  .   These are all intrinsically interlinked,  and when combined they (hopefully)  provide a richer and more characterful  game than simple changing the type of  tanks available to each side, but then  fighting the same battles with them.  Whether it is mass tank charges of the  Red Army, or the desperate ‘last stand’  resistance of the German Army in Berlin  in 1945, Battlegroup seeks to put this  central to the gaming experience  .  Some  WWII wargamers chose a particular  theatre to recreate, and hone their  miniatures and terrain collections to it  .   Some chose multiple theatres, whilst  others prefer to keep in generic, and  play in lots of theatres  .  Battlegroup tries  to cater to all approaches, but hopefully  those with the a specialist period will  find their games enhanced by the  character the rules seek to ‘hard-wire’  into the system  . Over time it is hoped that we will be  able to publish an ever expanding range  of theatre supplements  .  Naturally,  the largest and most popular theatres  demand our attention first, but others  will follow  .   So, muster your forces, make your plans  and prepare to engage your enemy  – ‘Panzer vorwärts!’ BATTLEGROUP Below: Men of 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade  advance towards Ranville, near Caen, 18 July 1944.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES HOW THIS BOOK WORKS Within this book you will find the  core information you need to play  Battlegroup, table-top wargames  recreating the battles of World War II  .   This book deals with the basic game  system, used in all games, regardless  of the army lists or theatre, or scenario  being used  .   First you will find the Command and  Control rules, which deals with issuing  and acting upon orders  .  Orders are  how you get you units to do things  on the tabletop, such as move, shoot,  call in artillery or mortar fire etc. You  are unlikely to have enough orders to  do everything you would like  .  This  is deliberate  .  Large forces become  unwieldly and hard to use well  .   Conversely, smaller forces, lacking in  men and equipment are easier to control,  but do they have enough forces to stop  the enemy and they will generally be  far easier to break  .  This is the balance of  the game  .   Secondly, it deals with movement  .  All  units have a basic movement allowance,  in inches, on the tabletop  .  This can be  effected by such things as obstacles and  difficult ground. It also deals with units  being transported or towed by vehicles  .   Third is firing. The heart of the game is  shooting at each other’s units, and there  are various ways of doing this  .  Area Fire  is a form of ‘quick’ firing, which allows  you to shoot-up an area and ‘suspected’  enemy units to keep them pinned  .  Area  Fire is mostly conducted with small  arms (bullets) and high-explosive shells  .   Aimed Fire is more involved, riskier, but  more likely to result in actual casualties  and the destruction of enemy units  .   Using both, at the right time, will go  along way towards achieving victory  . Fourth is morale, which takes two forms;  individual unit morale, ie  .  how a unit  reacts to being under fire, taking hits and  casualties, and the overall battlegroup  morale  .  Ultimately, it is battlegroup  morale that will determine victory, and  this uses the ‘Battle Rating’ system of  drawing random counters from a pot  .   Other special rules for aircraft, anti- aircraft fire and battlefield engineering  are also covered  .   GETTING STARTED It is not necessary to learn all the rules  presented here before you play  .  It is far  easier to read the rules through once,  get some miniatures out on the tabletop  and start moving them around and  rolling some dice  .  A small introductory  game is the simplest way to start, with  just a few infantry and tanks  .  From this  small beginning you can then build up  your games to include artillery, aircraft,  engineers and all the other specialist  units  .  After two or three games you  will have mastered the basics and  have a good understanding of the rule  mechanics  .   6 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES GAMING PRINCIPLES These rules assume a few basic  principles that both players should  adhere to  .  These are: i. Co-operation Like all games, there is also a social side  to wargaming  .  It is a shared experienced,  and both sides are supposed to enjoy  themselves  .  Games are best played in  a spirit of friendly co-operation  .  Being  ruthlessly competitive, nit-picking over  rules or line of sight decisions and not  accepting the vagaries of lady luck with  good grace only serves to ruin the game  for everybody  .  This is not a competitive  sport  .  So play as friends, give your  opponent the benefit of the doubt, play  to win but don’t worry overly about  who wins or loses  .  It is a game – for fun,  so enjoy yourself and make sure your  opponent does too  .   ii. Scale This game is written for miniatures  at two sizes  .  20mm (1/72nd scale and  1/76th) and 15mm (1/100th scale)  .   Models in these sizes are commonly  available and can provide a good-sized  game on a 6'x4' table top in an evening  .   Of course, larger games, with more  models and larger tables can also be  played (and should be)  .  In the end  the best advice here is to play on the  largest table you can manage  .  A word of  warning: too many models on too small  a table makes for a poor game, with no  room for decisive manoeuvre; instead it  will become a dull grind of attrition and  dice rolling  .  Advice on table size for both  scales of models is given later  .   iii. Measuring Distances This can be a fraught issue when  distances become critical to victory  or defeat  .  Distances should never be  premeasured  .  The troops on the ground  have to estimate them, so should you  .   When measuring distances, always  measure from the firing vehicle’s hull  to the target vehicle’s hull, not from the  end of the gun barrel  .  Some tanks have  very long guns and can thus gain extra  distance on the tabletop  .  Likewise, when  measuring for damage or if a vehicle  is within a blast radius, use its hull for  determining distance  .  Just because a  piece of modelled stowage or a long  barrel is in range, does not mean the  vehicle itself is  .   For infantry units, when moving, no  element within a unit should move more  than its maximum movement allowance  .   When measuring ranges the majority  matter – so, if more models in a unit are  at short range than effective range, the  unit counts as being at short range  .   iv. Gauging Line of Sight Mostly this will be obvious, but  sometimes it is unclear whether a unit  can see another  .  There is no easy way  to settle this, and it comes down to  the players to decide  .  As a guide, a  firer should be able to see a reasonable  amount of its target, not just a gun barrel  sticking out  .  In the event that the players  can’t decide, roll a dice for it  .  1-3 the  target can’t be seen; 4-6 it can, so take  the shot  .  Players should also remember  rule i  .  above – be generous and give the  benefit of any doubt to the firer, and  expect the same in return  . v. Units In the game a ‘unit’ is single thing, given  a single order  .  It might be an infantry  squad or team of several models, or a  single vehicle or gun (including their  crew)  .  The army lists often allow players  to purchase multiple units together as  platoons, squadrons, batteries etc, but  these are still separate units and need to  given their own orders  .   WHAT YOU WILL NEED Before you can play a game, you are  going to need some vital stuff  . 1. Battle Groups You will need two battlegroups of  miniature soldiers, tanks and guns  – one for each side  .  These will be from  the players’ collections, (or from one  player’s collection), and should be the  right models, and should be painted  .  Of  course, what level of painting is up to  the players, but the game is drastically  enhanced by using well-painted  miniatures. Those willing to field  unpainted models need to take a hard  look at themselves and seek forgiveness  for their sins against gaming! (Seriously  though, paint the models, it is a major  part of the wargaming hobby)  .   2. Rulebook Well, if you’re reading this you have  one  .  The more experienced you become  with the rules, the less you’ll refer to the  rulebook, until eventually you might  not need it at all – ironic, that! The rules  reference sheet also provides all you  need to play  . 3. Theatre Supplement These are the basic rules, you’ll also  need a theatre supplement, for its army  lists, game profiles, special rules and  scenarios  . 7 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 8 Wargames tables come in many shape and  sizes, usually attempting to recreate the  character, look and terrain of the theatre of the  battle being played. Above is a 6' x 4' table  for the Eastern Front in 1943. Below, a 6' x  6' D-Day table for recreating the landings at  Omaha Beach, Normandy in 1944.   

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 9 4. Opponent(s) Somebody to play against as the  opposing commander  .  Great games  can also be played with multiple  commanders on each side  . 5.   Battlefield A good-sized flat area on which to place  the model terrain. Any flat area will  do, dining room table, floor etc, but a  purpose built wargaming table is best  .   The larger the better really, but 4'x4'  is regarded as the smallest practical  gaming table  .  Most of us use a 6'x4' or  a bit larger  .  A lucky few have far larger  tables (see right)  . 6. Dice This game is played using six-sided  dice, referred to as D6  .  They are easily  available at gaming stores or online and  about ten should do  .  You might also  need a twelve-sided dice (D12)  .   7. Pen and Paper The game requires some book-keeping  and note taking, so a pen and paper will  come in handy for this  .  You will also  have a Battle Group Organisation Chart  (see Appendix), and the back of this  comes in handy for notes, etc  . Above: Wargamers also come in many shape  and sizes.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES YOUR BATTLE GROUP In order to play, you are going to  need a battlegroup  .  Collecting and  painting miniatures is a large part of the  wargaming hobby, and as such building  up this collection can become something  of  life’s work for dedicated (obsessive)  wargamers (author included here)  .   The theatre supplements each include  different ‘types’ of army, the principal  combatants of war at that time, and each  has its own advantages, disadvantages  and ‘style’ of player  .  You’ll learn the  ins and outs as you go, but suffice to  say, infantry-based forces, often backed  up by artillery, will fight very different  battles to mobile armoured units with  lots of tanks  .   The heart of your hobby is your  collection of miniatures, but this should  not be confused with your battlegroup  .   A battlegroup is small combined-arms  force created for a specific game. Your  collection will be far larger, and include  many different units  .  You won’t use  them all every game, but occasionally  you will be able to get them all out  and have a really big battle  .  As most  wargamers find, their collection is rarely  complete, there is always something  to add or new models to include  .  If,  by some good fortune, an army is  completed, then invariably they start on  another one  . ARMY LISTS, POINTS AND  BATTLE RATING The theatre supplement’s army lists  contain a lot of different units, from  infantry squads and tanks, to command  units, signal teams, artillery, medics, etc  .   Each is listed with a points value and a  battle rating  . Points values are how you pick a force  .   In simplistic terms, the higher the points  value, the ‘better’ the unit  .  A powerful  tank with a big gun is worth more  than an infantryman with a mere rifle.  Heavy artillery is worth more than light  artillery  .  When picking a force, it will be  to a maximum points value, set by the  players before the game  .  If both sides  have an equal number of points, then  you will get an even game (well, that is  the theory)  .  Of course, how you use the  force, your luck on the day, and lots of  other factors will ultimately decide who  gets the victory  . Units also have a battle rating  .  This  is discussed in detail later, but a  unit’s battle rating is a gauge of the  effectiveness and importance of your  battlegroup, and will be very important  in deciding whether you win or lose  a game  .  See page 43 for full details on  battle rating  . NOTES ON INFANTRY BASING How infantry are based doesn’t really  have an impact on the game, as long as  it is obvious which squad the models  belong to, then any basing method  will work  .  Individual basing obviously  allows for the easy removal of casualties,  but multiple basing allows for faster  movement and easy identification. If  using multiple bases, the best thing to  do is also have a few markers or small  dice to show casualties sustained by  the base. So, a five man base would  remain on the table until all five men  have become casualties, but after four  casualties would only have a Rate of Fire  of 1  .  This additional bookkeeping won’t  affect game play at all  .  A combination  of multiple bases and single figures is  probably the best compromise  .    GAME SIZE This game is designed to be played at  four different sizes, from small squad  vs squad actions up to larger battalion  actions  .  The larger the game, the more  miniatures you’ll need, as well as a  correspondingly larger tabletop  .  Below is  a guideline for the minimum, maximum  and standard recommended points  required for the different sized games, as  well as a recommended table size  . Game Size    Minimum   Maximum    ‘Standard’    20mm    15mm   Points   Points    Points   table size   table size Squad   100   350   250   6' x 4'   4' x 4'   Platoon   351   750   500   6' x 6'   6' x 4' Company   751   1250   1000   6' x 8'   6' x 6' Battalion   1251   2000+   1500   6' x 10'    6' x 8'           or larger   or larger 10 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES THE RULES penetration operations  made the tactics of World  War I redundant  .  Better  tanks and tactics, from the  lessons learnt in Poland,  would see the French and  British armoured forces  outmatched in 1940  .  North  Africa would see the British  Army learn these lessons  and, despite early defeats, eventually  match German tactics with their own  .   Later, when the US Army entered that  theatre, they soon found their own  inexperienced tank crews struggling  against the panzers  .  But the US Army  had its own distinct advantages to bring  to bear – their war industries could keep  their forces far better supplied with  replacements, fuel and ammunition, all  equally vital (if not more so) to victory  .   If these rules only concerned themselves  with crew skill, vehicle specifications  and battlefield tactics then the US Army  in North Africa might never win a  game  .  But they did win, and drove the  Germans out  .  So these rules will give the  US some of their national advantages,  and make those advantages worthwhile  using, to the point that it balances the  other factors  .  Two different armies;  one small, well-equipped and well- experienced, one larger, inexperienced  and lacking cutting edge equipment,  can then still fight a balanced, and  historically more accurate, game  .   The same can said for other theatres  too  .  From the mass conscript armies  of the Soviet Union, with seemingly  inexhaustible resources to expend, to the  last desperate defenders of Germany,  poorly trained and seemingly without  a hope against the odds facing them, a  historical balance can be found  .   CHARACTER AND BALANCE IN  WORLD WAR II BATTLES The reason why Battlegroup exists is to  try and infuse World War II wargames  with more historical character  .   Obviously, some elements are common  to all the battlefields of the war. From  the Pacific to North Africa and Western  Europe, the presence of tanks, infantry,  artillery and (mostly) aircraft are a given,  but they weren’t always available in the  same numbers, or deployed with the  same tactics  .   To help explain further we’ll use the  example of tanks  .  Tanks, and the appeal  of fighting tank battles, is really the  biggest draw towards playing World  War II wargames  .  This is not to say that  great games can’t be played with just  infantry, but World War II was the war  of the tank  .   Tank warfare developed  rapidly and beyond all recognition over  the course of six years of fighting. In  1939, the tank was still in its infancy,  with many nations reliant on the tactics  developed in World War I, or some  having yet to develop any tanks at all  .   By 1945, tanks design had turned those  first slow, cumbersome and under- armed vehicles (and the small, fast and  under-armoured ones) into fearsome  behemoths with far thicker armour,  more powerful guns and better engines  .   Of course the rules need to represent  this, in detail – and they do, using  each vehicle’s individual stat line (just  like other Wold War II games)  .  But the  doctrines for the use of tanks had also  changed, and not just generally, but  specifically for each nation.  Mechanised warfare was in its infancy  when the German Army unleashed their  blitzkrieg  on Poland in September 1939  .   The age of lightning attacks and deep  The fearsome Tiger I 11 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES T HE  T URN &  O RDERS THE TURN Battlegroup is played in turns  .  The  players take it in turns to command  their forces, issue orders and resolve  those orders, before the turn passes to  their opponent, who then repeats the  sequence with their own forces  .  There  are exceptions to this rule, but in general  the game works by both players taking a  ‘go’, one after the other  .   Each player’s turn is played out in order,  following the steps below  . 1. Roll Orders Dice Roll the number of D6 determined by  the game size, and add the number of  officers in the battle-group. 2. Issue First Order Choose any unit and issue it an order  .   Resolve the order before moving to  the next unit  . 3. Issue Second Order Choose another unit and issue it  an order  .  Resolve the order before  moving to the next unit  . 4. Issue Third Order, etc... Choose another unit and issue it  an order  .  Resolve the order before  moving to the next unit  .  Continue  this process until all orders have been  issued  . 5. Rally Remove pinning markers from  pinned units (see later)  .   Once a player has removed any pinning,  the turn passes to his opponent,  beginning again at step 1  .   ORDERS, OFFICERS    AND REACTIONS Each turn a commander (that’s you)  can issue a pre-determined number of  orders  .  The orders are determined at  the start of the turn by rolling dice  .  The  number of dice is determined by the  size of game  .  Small games use fewer  dice than larger ones, because you have  fewer units needing orders  .  Games are  split into four different sizes  .  Squad- level, Platoon-level, Company-level and  Battalion-level, determined by the points  values of the battlegroups involved  .   Squad   1D6 Platoon   2D6 Company   3D6 Battalion   4D6 As well as the dice roll, the player also  adds to this score his battlegroup’s  Above: A Red Army observer team watch for the  approach of the enemy from their trench (Novosti 851334)  US senior officer unit 12 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES total number of officers. These are the  men running the battle and passing  on the orders, so the more officers in  a battlegroup, the more effective a  fighting force will be at disseminating  information and getting units into  action  .  So, if a battlegroup includes three  officers in a platoon-level game, then the  player would roll 2D6 and add 3 to the  total  .  In a Battalion-level game he would  roll 4D6 and add 3  .   Whilst creating your battlegroup you  will need to keep a note of how many  officers your battlegroup includes. If,  during the course of the battle, you lose  officers to enemy fire, or from morale  effects, then the officer total will go  down – obviously officers that have  been killed, wounded or are otherwise  indisposed by enemy fire can’t do much  to help run the battle, so you suffer the  results  . REACTION ORDERS This is a battle, and each side is seeking  to destroy the other  .  Your units cannot  expect to move around the battlefield  without attracting the attention of the  enemy  .  An alert enemy will react to  your movement and firing, often by  firing back! This is covered by Reaction  Orders  .   In your turn you can issue your units  one of the two Reaction Orders, either  Ambush Fire or Reserve Move  .  These  allow that unit to take its order in your  opponent’s turn, missing your current  turn in order to wait, see what happens  and react to it (hence the name)  .   You can issue as many Reaction Orders  as you wish and your orders total allows,  but be warned, an over-use of Reaction  Orders will hand the initiative in the  battle to your opponent, and he will  be dictating where, when and how the  battle happens  .  Conversely, do not ignore  Reaction Orders; they are very useful  and add a different dynamic to the game  .   Well-used they are very powerful and  can have a big effect on the outcome of a  battle  .  You will need to strike a balance  between attack and defence, but how  you do this is left up to you  . 13 Reaction Orders are only ever used in  the opponent’s turn  .  See ‘Using Reaction  Orders’ later for full details. Suffice to  say here that just because it is your turn,  it doesn’t mean the enemy has to sit  around and do nothing! Example of Orders: It is a Company-level game, with four  officers on player A’s side and three on  player B’s side. In player A’s turn he will roll 3D6 and add  4 for his orders total. He rolls 2, 3 and 5. So  he will have (2+3+5+4 officers) or 14 orders  to issue. In player B’s turn he will also roll 3D6 and  add 3. He rolls 1, 4 and 4. He will have 12  orders to issue, (1+4+4+3 officers). 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES ISSUING ORDERS Once the commander has determined  the number of orders he can issue, he  can set about using them  .  Orders allow  units to act, generally by moving and  shooting (although there are some  special orders as well to deal with other  battlefield situations).  To issue an order, the commander  simply selects a unit and says what  order they are to receive  .  That unit  then acts upon the order and, once it is  complete, the commander moves on to  nominate the next unit for an order, and  declares what it is  .  This continues until  all his allowed orders have been issued  .   During play, it is easiest if the opposing  player keeps track of the orders,  counting them off as they are issued,  until there are none left  . A unit can only be issued a single order  per turn, so once it has had its orders  for this turn, it can’t have another  .   Also, a unit which is pinned cannot be  issued any order, as it is currently too  busy avoiding being shot at to take any  constructive part in the battle  .   When there are no orders left to be  issued, or the commander does not wish  to issue any more orders, the orders  phase is over and the turn moves on to  the Rally phase  . Note: The easiest way to track orders is  to use dice, with the opponent turning  the dice as the orders are used up  .   USING REACTION ORDERS The orders sequence detailed above can  (and will) be interrupted by Reaction  Orders, either Ambush Fire or Reserve  Movement  .  As with other orders, a unit  can be issued a Reaction Order in its  own turn, but cannot do so if pinned  .   Any unit that is issued a Reaction Order  will not act in its own turn, but will wait,  and act by interrupting the enemy’s  turn  . A unit can act on its Reaction Order at  any point in the enemy’s turn  .  It can  jump in straight away, before a single  enemy unit has been given an order,  or it can wait until the very end, before  the Rally phase starts  .  It can also be  used to interupt an enemy unit’s order,  midway through a move or firing before  an enemy unit opens fire itself. This  freedom of action makes reaction orders  very useful  .   If a unit with a reaction order becomes  pinned before it has acted, then it cannot  now act, but it retains its order for when  it becomes unpinned  . ORDERS Issuing orders is the way a commander  gets his units to do things, like move  and shoot  .  It is the basic mechanism  that drives the game  .  After selecting an  unpinned  unit, a commander can issue  it a single order from the list below  . •  Manoeuvre and Fire The unit will move into position then  open fire. It may make a single move,  up to its full normal movement  distance (see Movement later) and  then take a single shot at an enemy  unit (see Open Fire!)  .   This can be any type of shot with any  available weapon  . •  Fire and Manoeuvre Same as above, but the unit will fire  before it moves. Take the shot first  (again any type of fire, with any  weapon), and then move up to the  unit’s full movement distance  . •  Top Speed The unit must move fast  .  It can  move up to twice its full movement  distance, but may not do anything  else; it’s moving flat-out. •  Open Fire! The unit will hold its position and lay  down heavy fire. The unit may fire  at the enemy twice, but must remain  stationary whilst doing so  .  The unit  can use any type of fire, with any  available weapons it has, and can  target the same enemy unit twice, or  two different enemy units, as long as  they are both in its arc of fire and line  of sight  .  Declare both targets before  rolling any dice  . •  Disembark/Embark A transport vehicle carrying  passengers will move then any  passengers units it wishes may  disembark  .  The transport vehicle may  move up to its normal movement  allowance, and then place any  disembarking units within 4" of  its final position. Alternatively, the  passengers can disembark first, then  the transport vehicle can move  .  If the  commander so chooses, he may elect  not to move the transport vehicle  at all, but open fire once instead of  moving  . To enter a transport vehicle, the  reverse is used  .  A unit within 4" of the  vehicle can embark after the vehicle  has made a standard move, or the  vehicle can make a standard move  after the infantry have embarked  .   •  Unlimber/Limber A transport vehicle towing a gun  will move then unlimber the gun  .   The towing vehicle may move up  to its normal movement allowance,  and then place the gun, and any  crew, within 4" of its final position.  Alternatively, the gun can be  unlimbered first, then the towing  vehicle moved  .  If the commander so  chooses, he may elect not to move  the towing vehicle at all, but fire the  vehicle’s weaponry once instead  . To limber a gun the reverse of  unlimber is used  .  A gun within 4" of  the vehicle can be limbered after the  vehicle has made a standard move,  or the vehicle can make a standard  move after the gun has limbered  . 14 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES •  Infantry Close Assault An Infantry unit will attempt to move  to within Close Assault range (5") and  engage the enemy in a Close Assault,  with pistols, grenades, bayonets,  rifle butts, etc. In order to press a  Close Assault, first roll a D6 to see if  the unit are ready and willing to get  stuck-in  . Unit Experience Test Inexperienced   4+ Regular   3+ Veteran   2+ Elite   2+ If they pass, continue the Assault  Order  .  If they fail, the unit does  nothing and is marked as pinned  . To press the assault, the infantry unit  (note, that vehicles and gun crews  can’t use the Close Assault order) may  move up to its normal movement  allowance (5"), and then conduct an  assault against a single enemy unit  .   Only by using the Close Assault order  does an infantry unit gain the Close  Assault bonuses (see later for full  rules)  .  If an infantry unit just uses the  Manoeuvre and Fire order to approach  the enemy, then he can still fire, but  this is treated as normal firing, with no  assault bonuses  .   Close Assault is also used for infantry  to attack enemy vehicles with  anti-tank grenades (see page 34 for  details)  .   •  Request Artillery Fire A unit with the Artillery Spotter  or Mortar Spotter special rule will  request indirect mortar or artillery  fire. The unit may not do anything  else this turn, as it calls in target  information and grid references and  corrects fall of shot  .  See Indirect  Artillery Fire for full details of how to  resolve this order  .   •  Tactical Co-Ordination Only a unit with the Senior Officer  special rule can be given the Tactical  Co-ordination order  .  The command  unit can then do nothing this turn,  but may nominate a friendly, pinned  unit to attempt to remove its pinned  marker  .  Take a Battle Counter  .  The  pinned unit must then pass a unit  experience test (as given under  infantry Close Assaults)  . •  Re-arm Only a unit with the Re-Supply  special rule can be given the Re-arm  order  .  The Re-Supply unit can do  nothing this turn, but any friendly  unit in contact with it can be re- supplied with new ammunition  . •  Engineering Only a unit with the Engineer special  rule can be given the Engineering  order  .  The engineers can use this  order to place their demolition  charges or remove minefields (see  Engineers later for details)  .  A unit can  do nothing else in the turn it is given  the Engineering order  . •  Repair Only a unit with the Repair special  rule can be given the Repair order  .   The unit can do nothing this turn, but  may attempt to roll to repair a single  immobilised or destroyed vehicle  . •  Recover Only a unit with the Recovery special  rule can be given the Recover order  .   The unit can do nothing this turn,  but next turn may begin to tow a  destroyed or immobilised vehicle,  moving at half its normal speed  .    •  Ambush Fire (Reaction Order) Mark the unit with a counter or  dice (or any other obvious marker)  .   The waiting ambush unit may now  interrupt any enemy unit’s order in  their next turn to use the Open Fire!  order  . The Ambush Fire is treated exactly as  the Open Fire! order, so the ambusher  can fire twice, using any type of fire  (or combination of types of fire) and  can also target two separate enemy  units (in range and line of sight)  .   Resolve the fire as normal. Ambush  Fire cannot be used with Indirect  Artillery, Mortar fire or Infantry Close  assaults  .   The marker is only removed once the  unit opens fires, or if the commander  chooses to remove it and give the unit  another order instead  .   •  Reserve Move (Reaction Order) A unit given the Reserve Move order  does not move in its own turn but  instead waits, and can then interrupt  the enemy turn (but not an order) to  take the Top Speed order, allowing it  to immediately make a double move,  using the normal movement rules  . The marker is only removed once  the unit moves, or if the commander  chooses to remove it and give the unit  another order instead  .   RALLY The last part of player’s turn is to rally  pinned troops  .  Units marked as pinned  can have their pinned markers removed,  thus getting them back in the battle  . To do this, the player must take a battle  counter from the pot  .  For each counter  taken, they may remove a D6 markers  from any pinned units he wishes  .  If two  counters are taken then 2D6 counters  can be removed  .  If three counters are  taken, then 3D6 counters are removed  and so on  .  Declare this before taking any  counters  . A commander does not have to take any  counters, he can leave units pinned (and  thus save the battle rating), but he won’t  be able to issue orders to the unit until  he removes the pinned marker  . 15 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES ORDERS ROLL First the commanding player rolls his  orders dice  .  It is a platoon-sized game,  and his battlegroup has two officers. He  rolls 2D6, getting a 4 and a 5  .  He will  have a total of 11 orders to issue (4+5+2)  .   FIRST ORDER The commanding player issues a Top  Speed order to a Panzer III tank, and  it moves up to twice its movement  allowance  . SECOND ORDER A Manoeuvre then Fire order to a  second Panzer III tank, which moves  up to engage a distant T-34 with aimed  anti-tank fire.  REACTION ORDER  (AMBUSH FIRE) His opponent, seeing his T-34 in danger,  decides to use Ambush Fire set last turn,  with a 45mm anti-tank gun  .  He decides  to take two shots at the threatening  Panzer III  .  It misses twice! SECOND ORDER -  COMPLETED The Panzer III completes its remaining  movement then opens fire at the T-34,  also missing  . THIRD ORDER Deciding to cover his Panzer III’s  advance, he places the third tank of  the squadron on Ambush Fire, ready  to engage any emerging threat in his  opponent’s next turn  .   FOURTH ORDER Next, he orders his forward observer  team to request artillery fire, using  a 1st target priority artillery request  .   He makes the required roll, then the  communications check to talk to a  divisional 120mm mortar battery  .   He places his target marker, rolls for  deviation, then orders the mortars to fire  for effect! FIFTH ORDER The first 120mm mortar Opens Fire!    and fires twice.  SIXTH ORDER The second mortar Opens Fire!    and fires twice.  Note, these four shots   are all resolved together  .   SEVENTH ORDER Mortar rounds complete, the seventh  order of the turn is for the player to use  his battlegroup forward commander  for the Tactical Co-ordination order  .  A  PaK-40 crew and its loader team are  currently pinned, and he wants them to  engage some enemy T-34s  .  The PaK-40  crew are Regulars, so after taking a  Battle Counter, they need to take a unit  experience test on 3+  .  They pass, and the  pinning marker is removed  .   EIGHTH ORDER Now unpinned, the Pak-40 is given the  Open Fire! order  .  First it rolls for its  loader team to see if it can get an extra  shot  .  It rolls a 5, and passes  .  The Pak-40’s  three shots will be two aimed fire shots  with armour-piercing shells at two T-34s,  and thirdly HE shells for Area Fire at an  enemy machine-gun team  .   These shots are resolved one at a time,  destroying one T-34 and pinning the  machine-gun team – good shooting  .   NINTH ORDER The ninth unit to receive orders is  an SdKfz 251/1, which will get the  Disembark order  .  First it makes a normal  move, then the Panzer Grenadiers and  MG team inside leap out and are placed  within 4" of the vehicle  .  That completes  its order  . TENTH ORDER The dismounted Grenadiers and the  MG team are both now available to be  given orders  .  The MG team are given  the Open Fire! order and will use Area  Fire twice, targeting two enemy infantry  units ahead. In the blaze of MG fire, one  enemy infantry unit becomes pinned  .   ELEVENTH ORDER The last order of the turn  .  The player  opts for another Disembark order for  another SdKfz 251/1  .  This time, the  vehicle will give up its movement to  take a shot, and uses Area Fire with  its machine gun to target an enemy  anti-tank rifle team. Then the Panzer  Grenadier squad and MG team inside  are placed within 4" of the vehicle  . REACTION ORDER  (RESERVE MOVE) Before the turn ends, the Russian player  interrupts again to use a Reserve Move  order he placed last turn on a T-34  .  He  pushes this T-34 forward with double it’s  movement, ready to get into the battle  in his turn  .   RALLY Finally, the German commander decides  to take a single battle counter to remove  pinning  .  He currently has three pinned  units  .  He takes the counter, it’s a 3, and  places it in his stack  .  He rolls the D6 and  scores a 4  .  He removes all three pinned  markers and the spare is lost  .   This ends the turn  . . .  Over to    the Russians  . Panzer III L EXAMPLE OF A TURN 16 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES M OVEMENT E ach unit has its own movement  distance, how far it can move on the  tabletop expressed as inches. How much  of its potential movement can be used is  dictated by a unit’s orders, but most of  the time a unit can make a single move  of the distance stated. Infantry Movement Infantry are small and nimble (compared  to tanks) and can quickly find their way  around, over or through obstacles that  would impede vehicles. An infantry  unit can always move 5", and this is  not affected by any movement modifier  unless it is dangerous terrain (see page  18). This distance is also not affected  by whether the unit is on a road or  moving cross-country.  When moving,  an infantry model must begin and end  its move within 1" (approximately) of  another member of its unit.   Cavalry Movement Horses are fast, sometimes very fast, but  they can’t get into the places infantry  can. A cavalry unit can move up to 8".  This is increased to 10" if the unit is  on a road, because roads are generally  flat(ish) and provide decent footing.  Once per game, a cavalry unit can make  a special ‘Charge!’ move. This allows  the unit to increase its speed to 12" for  that turn, but once a cavalry unit has  charged, it cannot charge again. Cavalry  units are affected by difficult ground,  obstacles and dangerous ground. Horse Towed Gun    (and horse and cart) Not as fast or nimble as cavalry, a  horse towed gun, or a horse towed cart  (usually a supply unit) can move up  to 4" off road and 6" on a road, and is  affected by difficult ground, obstacles  and dangerous ground. Bicycle Some units were equipped with bicycles,  to speed their movement to combat (not  to fight from). A bicycle unit can move  up to 3" off road, but this is increased to  10" whilst they remain on a road. Manhandled Gun Guns without towing vehicles, or a horse  and limber, have to be pushed by their  crew – this is hard, slow work. How  far a gun can be moved is determined  by its size. Very Light guns can be  manhandled up to 3". Light guns can  be manhandled up to 2". Medium guns  can be manhandled up to 1", and Heavy  guns cannot be manhandled at all,  requiring a towing vehicle or horse and  limber because they are just too big.  Above: Red Army soldiers advance under the covering fire  of their DP light machine gunner and his loader. (Novosti 881063)  17

This is the distance  a vehicle can move, depending upon  where it is. The road value can only be  used if the vehicle starts its movement  on a road and remains on a road for  its entire move, and represents the  vehicle’s maximum speed. Otherwise,  use the vehicle’s off-road movement  allowance. This distance takes into  account the vehicle type. So, a wheeled  vehicle might be fast on a road, but  will generally be slower off-road than  a tracked vehicle. Vehicles designed  for road travel (such as trucks, etc) will  find their off-road movement distances  severely restricted because they lack  the traction and suspension needed for  sustained off-road movement.  Aircraft Aircraft are, of course, very fast. An  aircraft has no movement distance;  instead it can move anywhere on the  tabletop it likes. TERRAIN EFFECTS Difficult Ground If any unit except infantry must move  through an area of difficult ground,  such as woods, marshes, broken or  rocky ground or piles of rubble, then  reduce its total movement distance by  a D6" per move it spends in the terrain.  A unit cannot be reduced to less than 1"  of movement, so it can’t be stationary.  If the dice roll indicates that the unit is  stationary, it can still struggle forwards 1".  Roll once for each move a unit makes in  difficult terrain. Obstacle If a unit must cross an obstacle, such as  a wall or a hedge, then again reduce its  total movement distance by D6". If the  reduction means the unit does not have  enough movement to cross the obstacle,  move it up to the obstacle instead. It can  roll again and cross the obstacle during  its next move. As with difficult ground, a  unit can always move at least 1". Dangerous Ground If a unit must move through an area of  dangerous terrain, such as over barbed  wire or through a minefield, across  scree-slopes etc, then it can only move  D6". The D6" result cannot exceed the  unit’s normal maximum speed, so an  infantry unit moving over or through  dangerous terrain that rolls a 6 does not  speed up, it moves its normal maximum  of 5" (they must have found a safe  route). Dangerous ground can also have  other effects on the unit (such as mines  going off), which are described in their  own rules. Impassable Terrain Some terrain, such as rivers or cliffs,  count as impassable. If a unit moves  into impassable terrain, then it counts  as destroyed. Note that some units  have special rules which allow them to  enter some impassable terrain, such as  amphibious units entering water, but  otherwise these terrain features just  block all movement. Vehicles Reversing Sometimes vehicles will want to reverse,  usually to back away from the enemy  whilst keeping their frontal armour  facing them. Reversing is treated as  crossing difficult ground, so reduce the  unit’s movement by D6", to a minimum  of 1". This is also affected by difficult  terrain or obstacles as normal. Entering and Exiting Buildings In order to enter a building, an infantry  unit must move so that the majority  of the unit is within 1" of the building  model (or its base). If a unit ends its  movement within 1" of the building,  then they can immediately be placed  inside the building.  In order to exit a building, an infantry  unit takes half its basic move, measured  from the building model (or its base), so  it can only move 2.5". VEHICLE PASSENGERS A transport vehicle carrying passengers  moves and fights as normal, and when  they move any passengers are naturally  carried with them. Once any passengers  have disembarked the vehicle, the  disembarked squad (or squads) become  separate units and must then be given  orders individually, until the passengers  re-embark. Panzer II F 18 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Whilst being transported inside a  vehicle, an infantry squad or team  cannot Open Fire! They must disembark  first. A unit with the Artillery Spotter,  Mortar Spotter or Air Spotter special  rules may be given the relevant orders  whilst still embarked. Any passenger vehicle can be given a  special ‘Withdraw’ order. This is the  same as the Top Speed order, allowing  the vehicle to move twice its normal  distance. If the vehicle then ends its  move within 10" of a table edge it can  be removed from play. This allows  transport vehicles to deploy their squads  and quickly get out of the battle. No  battle counter is taken for leaving the  table. TANK RIDERS It was common practice for any  armoured vehicle to carry infantry,  because it beats walking! These are  referred to as tank riders (whether they  are actually on a tank or not).   They act just like other vehicle  passengers, but are far more exposed.  They can be targeted separately to  the vehicle, and thus can be pinned  separately, and count as in soft cover. If the transporting tank is hit by enemy  fire, then the tank riders are immediately  disembarked (they don’t hang around  with shells impacting around them).  They are marked as pinned. If the  vehicle they are riding is destroyed  by the hit, then D3 (a D6 divided by 2,  round fractions up) tank riders are also  killed and a morale test must be taken. OVERRUNNING DEPLOYED GUNS Given the size and weight of tanks, an effective way to destroy enemy guns is  simply to run over them! Any  tracked tank, assault gun or other  armoured fighting vehicle (this  does not include half tracks, or  tracked soft-skinned vehicles) can  attempt to overrun and damage/ crush a deployed enemy gun.  To do this, the tracked vehicle  is issued the Manoeuvre and Fire order, but the fire order is replaced by its  ‘Overrun’ attack. Of course, the targeted gun may use any Ambush Order to  get a last ditch shot, before it is rolled over, if the attacker is in its normal line  of sight. If the attacking tank reaches the gun, then the gun must make a Cover  save or be destroyed. Guns inside hardened defences, such as bunkers, or  deployed inside buildings, cannot be overrun.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES O PEN  F IRE! T   here are many different types of  weapons and many different types  of target, and this chapter deals with  them all, from an infantryman armed  with a rifle or submachine gun, up to  the largest calibre howitzers, multiple  rocket launchers, flamethrowers, anti- aircraft cannons and everything else.  These weapons also have various effects,  depending upon the target. Firing is  dealt with in two different ways, with  different effects. The first is Area Fire  and the second is Aimed Fire. Area Fire  is less accurate and less likely to cause  death and destruction, but is more likely  to pin a target. Aimed Fire is shooting at  a visible and identified enemy to destroy  it. Do not fall into the trap of believing  that Aimed Fire is somehow ‘better’ than  Area Fire, both have an important place,  and pinning an enemy is a very useful  tactic, because an unpinned enemy is  able to move and fire back, whilst a  pinned one can be manoeuvred against  to get into a good position to destroy  them. You will need to use both to  achieve victory... FIRING BASICS There are two rules that all units firing  at the enemy, by whatever method, must  comply with. The first is line of sight, the  second is range. A target unit must be  within the firing unit’s line of sight and  range before it can be engaged with any  type of fire. FIRE ARCS All units have an arc of fire, depending  upon what type of the unit they are. Infantry All infantry squads and teams have a  360° arc of fire. They are nimble and fast  enough to be able bring their weapons to  bear quickly in any direction. Deployed Guns A deployed gun or mortar has a 90°arc  of fire to the front. If a target unit is not  within this forward arc then it cannot  be targeted. Vehicles Vehicles with fixed weapons (not in  turrets or pintle-mounted) have a 45°  arc of fire to the front. If a target unit is  not within this limited arc of fire, then it  cannot be targeted. T34/43 20 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Turrets If a vehicle’s weapon is mounted in (or  on) a turret, it has a 360°arc of fire.  Pintle-Mounts A vehicle with a pintle-mounted  weapon, such as a machine gun, has a  360°arc of fire. If the pintle-mount is on  top of the turret, then this is independent  of the direction the turret is facing. BASIC RANGES All weapons have a maximum range,  summarized here. If a target unit is  beyond this maximum range then it is  automatically missed.

The men or crew might be  hiding in a ditch nearby, manoeuvring to find  better concealment or just hugging any cover, but  they can’t do much else. A unit can only have one  pinned marker at a time. Additional pinned results  have no further effect. A pinned unit cannot be  given any orders, and will thus do nothing until its  pinning marker is removed.  Panzer IVH OPEN FIRE! If a unit’s order allows it to open fire,  then the commanding player can choose  which type of fire he will use, what type  of ammunition he will use (if he has a  choice, such as armour-piercing shells  or high-explosive shells) and he must  nominate an enemy unit as his target.  He must state these before he begins to  resolve the firing or rolls any dice, and  they cannot be changed once any dice  have been rolled. Example of Firing Basics  A T-34 has been given the Fire and  Manoeuvre order. Before firing, it must  choose a type of fire; in this case it will be  Aimed Fire. It must select which weapon  or ammunition to use. As a tank, it has  machine guns and its main gun. It will  use its main gun, which can fire either  high-explosive or armour piercing shells.  Its target (in line of sight and range) is  an enemy anti-tank gun, so it selects a  high-explosive shell. This will be resolved as  aimed fire with high-explosive shells. 21 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A REA  F IRE WITH SMALL ARMS, MACHINE GUNS & HIGH-EXPLOSIVE SHELLS A rea fire is used to harass the     enemy, keep their heads down  and generally scare the willies out of  them! Its primary intention is not to kill  the enemy, although casualties might be  caused as a desirable side effect of the  hot lead flying about. Its primary role is  to pin the enemy, and generally make it  difficult or impossible for them to move  or fight back. Keeping the enemy under  a hail of bullets and shells will go a long  way to achieving victory, because most  soldiers would rather take cover and  stay there when the bullets are coming  thick and fast, rather than get up and  fight back. This is the main effect of area  fire – making it hard for the enemy to  fight back. USING AREA FIRE When a unit opens fire, it can choose to  use Area Fire, spraying the area with  bullets and shells. Follow the steps  below. 1. Roll for Area Fire Effect.      See the Area Fire Effect Table. 2. Roll the target unit’s Cover Save. 1. AREA FIRE EFFECT TABLE Cross Reference the firing unit’s Rate of  Fire, or the type and size of shell being  used, and the range to the target, with  the target unit type. This will give the  die roll required to pin the target unit. If  the test is passed, the unit must make a  cover save. If it fails, then the firing was  too wild and has no effect. A ‘-’ mark  means that there is no chance of causing  pinning against that target with this  weapon. 2. COVER SAVE Under fire, men seek cover; it is a natural  response, and the better the cover, the  better the chance of survival. Of course,  this also applies to gun crews and  vehicle crews. A vehicle, well concealed  or dug-in to cover is also better  protected than one in the open, but it  is far harder to hide a tank than a man.  This is represented by a Cover Save.  Open As it says, the unit is not in any cover  represented on the table. Players should  remember that even in the open, infantry  will find some form of cover. Bushes  and long grass provide cover, as well as  dips in the ground not represented upon  a flat wargaming table. Soldiers under  fire can always lie low for cover, and we  assume that they do, even though our  static model soldiers cannot. MG42 heavy    machine gun team 1.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Soft Cover The unit has some form of cover that  makes it harder to see them, even if it  wouldn’t be very effective at stopping  a bullet or shrapnel. This might include  woods, bushes or an overgrown thicket,  crop fields (when ripe), or a wooden  fence.  Hard Cover The unit has good cover that makes it  harder to see them and would stop a  bullet. This could be inside a building, or  behind stone wall. Dug-in vehicles also  count as in hard cover against area fire.  Reinforced Cover This is improved hard cover, designed  to withstand fire, such as in trenches  and foxholes. It could also represent  a fortified position, such as buildings  reinforced as defensive positions. This  also includes bunkers and strongpoints  constructed of wood. Hardened Cover This is the toughest cover, designed  to withstand the heaviest fire, such as  concrete bunkers or reinforced pillboxes.  Units inside will be very difficult to pin. PINNING If the target unit fails to pass its Cover  Save, then it is marked as pinned. A  pinned unit cannot be given any orders  until its pinning marker is removed.  AREA FIRE AND CASUALTIES Of course, with shells landing and  bullets fizzing past, there is a chance that  there will be casualties. If an infantry  unit or a deployed gun rolls a 1 for  its cover save, then as well as being  pinned, the unit also takes one casualty,  wounded or killed by the fire. No morale  test is required for this loss. Vehicles are  not affected, they just become pinned.  Example of Area Fire A German heavy MG42 team is given the  Open Fire! order, and chooses to target Area  Fire at a Russian infantry unit, 18” away,  and a supporting SU-76, 27" away. The  heavy machine guns RoF is 8, so at 18" it  needs a 4+ to pin the infantry, and a 6+ for  the open-topped armoured vehicle.  The HMG team roll a 5 and a 6, passing  both. The infantry are in the open, so need a  6 cover save. They roll a 1 and fail, and are  marked as pinned. They also take a single  casualty because of the roll of a 1. The SU-76  is obscured in a treeline, it needs a 6, and  rolls a 4, failing. It too is now marked as  pinned. Above: Infantry of the Regina Rifles  occupy cover in a damaged store front.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A IMED  F IRE WITH SMALL ARMS & MACHINE GUNS A imed Fire is observing the target  and trying to hit and destroy it.  This is far harder to do than Area Fire,  which just requires the bullets and shells  to land in vaguely the correct area.  Aimed Fire requires proper sighting and  judgement to actually hit the target(s),  not always easy in the heat of battle.  Aimed Fire is a little more involved than  Area Fire and requires the commander  to complete the following steps: 1.  Observe the target 2.  Roll to Hit the target 3.  Target’s Cover Save 4.  Target’s Morale test 1.OBSERVATION Before a unit can fire at an enemy target,  it must know that it is there. This is  called observation. As the battlegroup  commander, you are removed from the  front line, not actually lying in the dirt  with the enemy ahead of you. Much  as you might wish your units to act  according to orders, they just won’t  always be able to. Observation covers all  of the possible reasons a unit might fail  to see and engage a target. To start with,  this is a battlefield; there is a lot of dust  and smoke, which isn’t easily shown  with models on a wargaming tabletop.  The dust and smoke make seeing the  enemy hard and it could momentarily  obscure a target.  In battle it is surprising how little of  the enemy soldiers can see. They rarely  get a clear view of them (if they did,  then the enemy would be dead), and  often fight entire battles without ever  seeing anything of the enemy, except  perhaps muzzle flashes, or the dead or  a few wounded prisoners afterwards.  Just because you, as the player, have  a God-like overview of the miniature  battlefield, those men (models) on the  ground do not. They are mostly crawling  around, keeping their heads down and  trying not to get hit.  The first step of any Aimed Fire is  observing the enemy. It is easier to spot  an enemy unit that has been firing than  one that hasn’t, because of the muzzle  flashes and smoke. Look up the relevant  target unit, apply any modifiers, and  roll a D6 to observe it. If the target is  ‘automatic’ do not roll, it is always  observed, regardless of any modifiers.  If the roll fails then no further action is  taken. Obscured simply means the unit  has any form of cover at all.  See the  Observation Table below. 2. TO HIT With the enemy observed, the next task  is to hit them. With small arms fire and  machine guns (up to and including  larger autocannons), this is done by  using the firing unit’s Rate of Fire (RoF).  Total up the unit’s RoF, and this is the  number of D6 that must be rolled to hit.  Also listed on the Small Arms table is  each weapon’s maximum range, beyond  which their RoF counts as 0, and the  minimum crew requirements to fire the  weapon. A weapon without the required  crew can still fire, but counts as half its  normal RoF (round fractions down).  Extra crew members do not add their  RoF to crew-served weapons, they have  other jobs and act as a reserve crew. The  Special column lists any other rules or  features.   AIMED FIRE ‘TO HIT’ TABLE Once the total RoF has been established,  take that number of D6 and roll to hit,  cross referencing against the range to the  target on the Aimed Fire ‘to hit’ table. 1. observation table Infantry in the Open Firing   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Infantry in the Open     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Obscured Infantry Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Obscured Infantry  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 4+ Deployed Gun in the Open Firing    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Deployed Gun in the Open   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Gun Firing    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Gun    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Vehicle in the Open Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Vehicle in the Open  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Vehicle Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Vehicle  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Aircraft    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Modifiers If the observing unit has the Scout special rule   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . +1 If the target unit is an Infantry team of three men of less  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . -1 2.  s M all   ar M s   rate   o F F ire Weapon    RoF   Maximum Range   Crew   Special Rifle	 1	 30 "   - SMG	 1(2)*	 10 "   - Light 	 MG	 2	 30 "   1 man Medium 	 MG	 5	 30 "   2 men Heavy 	 MG	 6	 40 "   3 men MG34 	 – 	 bipod 	 mount	 5	 30 "   2 men MG 	 42 	 – 	 bipod 	 mount	 6	 30 "   2 men MG34 	 – 	 tripod 	 mount	 7	 40 "   2 men MG42 	 – 	 tripod 	 mount	 8	 40 "   2 men Tank MG  (bow, co-axial, etc) 	 3	 30 " Pintle 	 mount 	 MG	 5	 40 "   Light Autocannon  (20mm) 	 6	 50 "   2 men   also Light HE Heavy Autocannon  (37mm and 40mm) 	 8	 50 "   3 men   also Light HE Multiple 	 Autocannons	 10	 50 "   2 men   also 2 x Light HE Multiple 	 Medium 	 MG 	 mount	 10	 30 "   3 men   Man-pack 	 Flamethrower	 10	 5 "   1 man   one shot only  .

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 3. COVER SAVE For each hit rolled the target unit must  take a Cover Save. The Cover Save is  exactly the same as for Area Fire, but  is repeated here for clarity. Note that  against aimed fire, make one save  against each hit, not just one save for  the unit. For each save failed, remove a  model as a casualty. 4. MORALE TEST The target unit might then be requested  to take a Morale test. See the Unit  Morale section for full details of this.  Suffice to say here, any casualties will  usually cause a Morale test to be taken. Damage to Infantry For each Cover Save failed, the target  unit must remove a model as a casualty.  If a unit is destroyed then take a battle  counter for its loss. Damage to Deployed Guns If a deployed gun is reduced to having  no crew remaining, then it counts as  destroyed. If a unit is destroyed, then  take a battle counter for its loss. Damage to Soft-skinned vehicles Soft-skinned vehicles are not designed  to take fire, and can quite easily be  destroyed. All soft-skinned vehicles have  a number of hits listed in the vehicle  data. Once they have taken this number  of hits, they are destroyed; until then,  they act as normal.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Example of Aimed Fire at Infantry A Russian Maxim machine gun team is  given the Open Fire! order, and chooses to  target a German Infantry squad 12 "  away,  and a German MG34 machine gun team  23 "  away. The infantry squad are in the  cover of a wheat field, but the MG team are  in the open. First, the Maxim rolls to observe the  infantry squad, which hasn’t fired, so the roll  needed is a 3+. A 6 is rolled so the Maxim  team has spotted them. The Maxim has a  RoF of 5, so five dice are rolled. At 12 "  they  need 4+ to hit. Three hits are scored. The  Germans are in a the wheat field, so require a  soft cover save of 5+. They save two, and one  man is hit and down. The German infantry  squad can’t use the Fall back! rule, because  they haven’t taken enough damage and are  in cover. They must now take a Morale test  because they lost a man. Next target. The MG34 team has been firing,  so will be spotted on a 2+. A 4 is rolled, and  it has been identified. The Maxim opens up  again, rolling five dice, needing 5+ to hit at  23 " . It scores two hits. The Germans take  their ‘in the open’ cover saves of 6+, but fail  both. Eek, two men from the three man team  are down. Instead of taking the casualties  the German player chooses to Fall back!  The Russian player moves them back to the  nearest cover (a wood line 7 "  away). One  man is lost in the retreat, and the unit is  marked as pinned. Any units inside a destroyed transport  vehicle (armoured or soft-skinned) take  D3 casualties, with no Cover save, are  immediately placed within 4" of the  wreck and marked as pinned. They must  then take a unit Morale test for the losses  (and trauma).  Damage to Transported Troops Troops being transported inside any soft- skinned vehicle can also be lost to enemy  fire. Any additional hits on the vehicle  count against the transported men  inside. So, if a medium truck can take  three hits and actually takes four, then  the extra hit counts against the troops  inside. A passenger squad may make a  soft cover save (5+) against the hits.  I nfantry caught in a hail of fire can opt  to avoid heavy casualties by using the  Fall back! special rule.  If any infantry unit is in the open and  takes two or more casualties from an   enemy unit’s fire, then they can choose  to Fall Back! This means they will only  take a single casualty but, instead of the  other losses, their opponent can move  the unit backwards (away from the  source of fire or from the closest enemy  unit) up to 10", or into any cover within  that 10", whichever is less (any cover  must be used if available). The unit is  marked as pinned after the move. The  casualty does not cause the unit to take a  morale test, they fell back instead.  Note, that an infantry unit cannot  choose to Fall Back! if it comes under fire  from which it takes no, or only a single  casualty, is pinned, or if it already has  some cover. The situation isn’t serious  enough to cause the infantry to seek  better cover or get out of the line of fire,  and they won’t give up any cover they  have whilst under fire.  Only infantry units (squads or teams) can  Fall Back! Vehicles cannot and neither  can the crew of a deployed gun or mortar  (because that’s called abandoning the  gun and is dealt with by unit morale).  Units which Fall Back! off the table count  as routed (ie. destroyed).  Gaz AAA truck with  motorised infantry Example of Fall back! A German infantry squad is attacking a  building occupied by a Russian squad.  Using the Infantry Assault order, the  Germans cross a low wall and move into  Close Assault range, but the Russians are  waiting and use Ambush Fire, scoring three  casualties. Rather than take the casualties  and the resulting morale test the Germans  choose to Fall back! The Russian player  moves them back to the low wall, as this  is the closest cover away from the fire and  less than 10" away (if there was no wall,  he could have just moved them back the  full 10"). The Germans remove just one  casualty, seek the protection of the wall, and  are marked as pinned. FALL BACK! Example of Aimed Fire at a Vehicle A German MG34 team is given the Fire and  Move order. First they will Open Fire! at a  Russian troop truck, just 9" away, then the  team will move back.  First they must Observe the truck. The truck  is a vehicle in the open, which didn’t fire (it  has no guns). They require a 2+, the roll is  a 5 and they pass. The crew cut loose. The  bipod mounted MG34 has a firepower of  five and needs 3+ to hit. Five hits are rolled  – ouch! As a vehicle in the open, the truck  has no Cover save, so takes three hits and is  destroyed. The extra two hits are passed on  to the passenger squad, which must make a  5+ cover save against them. One is saved,  and one man is removed. The squad is placed  within 4" of its wrecked truck and marked as  pinned. Because of the casualty, the infantry  must now take a morale test as well.  26 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES INFANTRY CLOSE ASSAULT ‘Grenade!’ All infantry squads and weapon teams  are assumed to have grenades. The  attacking unit can add an extra D6 to  its total RoF, as men begin to post and  throw grenades into enemy positions.  Infantry vs Infantry    at Close Assault Range This is likely to be deadly for both  sides. An infantry unit engaging the  enemy at 5" range or less adds up its  total RoF value as normal, including the  extra D6 for thrown grenades and bold  individuals charging in, bayonet fixed or  entrenching tool in hand. Observation  is automatic in close assaults. Such  boldness is also potentially lethal to the  attacker, and the enemy will fight back.   Simultaneous with resolving the  assaulting unit’s fire, an unpinned  enemy unit can fire back. Resolve  this as normal, without any order  required. Note, the defenders get  their bonus for having SMGs, and  but do not get a ‘Grenade!’ bonus.  Both sides make Cover saves against  any hits as normal. If both sides are  inside the same building, they both  count as in hard cover. Units may not  Fallback! from a close assault. T   here is an order that allows  infantry units to Close Assault  the enemy, using bayonets, sub- machine guns, grenades and so on, to  maximum effect. When an infantry  unit uses the Infantry Close Assault  order to get to within 5" of an enemy  unit a few special rules are used,  detailed below. Close Assault is also  used for attacking enemy vehicles  with anti-tank grenades and other  improvised anti-tank weapons (see  anti-tank grenades on page 34). Sub-Machine Guns At their most effective in close  assaults, a sub-machine gun has its  firepower increased to 2 when used at  under 5" for an Infantry Close Assault.  Above: SU-76s provide support for an  infantry assault. (Novosti 851285) 27 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES I NFANTRY  W EAPONS  OF  W ORLD  W AR II Rifles Enfield MkIV, M1 Garand, Mosin- Nagant and Mauser Kar 98K were  the standard service rifles of the main  combatants. They are all rifles, and as  such have a RoF of 1, and a maximum  range of 30". All infantry are assumed to  have a rifle, even if gun crew or a rear  echelon supply unit.  Sub-Machine Guns General service sub-machine guns  were the US Thompson, British Sten,  Russian PPsH, and the German standard  service weapons were the MP38 and  MP40. Only really useful in close  contact with the enemy, SMGs really  come into their own in Close Assaults.  A single infantryman per squad, with  the appropriately armed model, can  be equipped with an SMG. They have  a RoF of 1 up to their maximum range  of just 10". In an assault they count as  having a RoF of 2.  Light Machine Gun Common, light squad support weapons  were the British Bren, US BAR and  Russian DP, known as the ‘record  player’ due to its distinctive circular pan  magazine. All light machine guns have a  RoF of 2 and a maximum range of 30".  Medium Machine Gun The US M1919 .30 calibre MG, British  Vickers and the Russian Maxim have a  RoF of 5, with a maximum range of 30"  or 40". It requires at least two men to  fire the weapon. If a single man is left  manning it, then its firepower is halved  (rounded down) to just 2. Heavy Machine Gun The US M2 .50 calibre HMG and the Red  Army’s DshK, were most often used as  a heavy anti-aircraft machine guns. So  good were they that they both remain  in service to this day. A HMG has a RoF  of 6, and a maximum range of 40". It  requires three men to fire the weapon. If  fewer crew are left manning it, then its  firepower is halved to 3. MG-34 The standard light machine gun of the  German Army from the start of the war,  it was usually fired from a bipod, as a  squad support weapon. In this case it  has a  RoF of 5 and a maximum range  of 30". It could also be mounted on a  tripod for sustained fire. In this case it  has a RoF of 7 and maximum range of  40". Regardless of its mount, the MG34  requires a crew of 2 to fire at full effect.  If reduced to a single man, then its RoF  is halved (rounded down) to 2 from a  bipod, and 3 from a tripod.  MG-42 A superb weapon with a ferocious rate  of fire, the MG-42 was a state of the  art weapon that only enter service in  1943. Fired from a bipod, it has a RoF  of 6 and maximum range of 30". When  mounted for sustained fire on a tripod,  it has a RoF of 8 and maximum range of  40”. Regardless of its mount, the MG42  requires a crew of two to fire at full  effect. If reduced to a single man, then its  RoF is halved (rounded down) to 3 from  a bipod, and 4 from a tripod. Autocannons Light cannons, usually with an  automated feed, were commonly fielded  as anti-aircraft weapons, but were  mounted on lighter vehicles as well.  They are versatile weapons and were  commonly used for ground fire.  20mm Light autocannons of roughly 20mm  calibre fire high-explosive tipped  rounds, as well as incendiary shells for  their extra damage against aircraft. They  have a RoF of 6 and have a maximum  range of 50". An autocannon can be used  for Area Fire, using either its RoF or its  very light HE rating, whichever is best.  It is treated as having a RoF 6 when  used for Aimed Fire. Against armoured  vehicles it can also be used for Aimed  Fire with armour piercing shells, in  which case treat it like any other armour  piercing shell. 37mm and 40mm Heavy autocannons of 37mm and 40mm  fire larger high-explosive and incendiary  shells, usually with a lower rate of fire,  but harder hitting impact. They have a  RoF of 8 and have a maximum range of  50". An autocannon can be used for Area  Fire, using either its RoF or its very light  HE rating, whichever is best. It is treated  as having RoF 8 when used for Aimed  Fire. Against armoured vehicles it can  also be used for Aimed Fire with armour  piercing shells, in which case treat it like  any other armour piercing shot. Flamethrowers As well as dealing with small arms RoF,  Aimed Fire also covers flamethrowers  – fearsome tools of war, lethal against  static targets like bunkers and buildings.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Flamethrowers are either man-pack, i.e.  carried by an infantryman, or vehicle  mounted. A man-pack flamethrower  has enough fuel for a single burst of  flame, so once it has been used it cannot  be used again. A vehicle mounted  flamethrower will have its ammunition  listed in its profile. Flamethrowers have a RoF of 10 and  can only be used against stationary  targets, be that a building or bunker  or a static vehicle. If the target moved  last turn then it cannot be targeted by  a flamethrower. This does not include  infantry inside buildings, which may  have moved into the building, but can  still be targeted because the building is  really the target. If used against a static  vehicle, they have a random penetration  value, determined by rolling a D6, and  always attack the vehicle’s side armour  value. A unit hit by a flamethrower also  counts as in the Open for Cover saves.  Flamethrowers are fearsome weapons,  hated by soldiers who, naturally, fear  their effects. The first time any enemy  unit is attacked by a flamethrower,  then its commander must take a battle  counter. This is because of the terror  such weapons instill in those at risk of  incineration. Light Mortars Light infantry support weapons of  approximately 50mm calibre (or 2"),  throwing small mortar bombs up to  approximately 500 metres. They have a  minimum range of 5" and a maximum  range of 20". They were generally being  removed from the orders of battle, but  many units retained them. They are  Very Light weapons with an HE rating  of 3/5+ and an armour penetration  value of 1. Light mortars cannot use  Indirect Fire (Direct Fire with HE or Area  Fire only). They count as infantry for  movement. Medium Mortars The standard battalion support weapon  for the fast delivery of high-explosives  and smoke bombs up to approximately  2.5km. 80mm, 81mm, 82mm and 3" all  saw wide service throughout the war.  They have a minimum range of 10" and  a maximum range of 90". They are Light  weapons with an HE rating of 4/4+ and  an armour penetration value of 2. They  count as very light guns for movement. Heavy Mortars Well loved for their fast response and  hard hitting impact, the standard  120mm heavy mortar (the Germans  copied theirs from the Russian design)  and British 4.2" provided infantry with  their heaviest high-explosive support  before calling upon artillery units – with  a range of approximately 6km. They  have a minimum range of 15" and a  maximum range of 240"! They are Light  weapons with a HE rating of 6/4+ and  an armour penetration value of 3. They  count as medium guns for movement. 29 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A IMED  F IRE WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVE SHELLS SU-76, the ‘bitch’ A s well as being very useful for      Area Fire, high-explosive shells  can also be used for Aimed Fire, in effect  getting the shell so close to a target that  it is destroyed by the blast. Any gun  with high-explosive shells can used  for Aimed Fire, by following the steps  below. 1. Observe the target 2. Roll to Hit the target 3. Roll for High-Explosive Damage 4. Target’s Cover Save 5. Target’s Morale test 1.OBSERVATION This is exactly the same as for all forms  of Aimed Fire, and is repeated here for  clarity. 2. TO HIT With the enemy sighted, the next task is  to hit them. With a high explosive shell,  this involves rolling to hit. Check the  score required to hit based on the range  to the target, add any modifiers and roll  a single D6. A miss has no effect.   The Rule of 1s and 6s Regardless of modifiers, a dice roll of  1 is always a miss. A dice roll of an 6 is  always a hit. So, even if a moving firer is  shooting at a target 40-50" away, which  moved and is obscured, a straight 6 will  still hit.  1  Extended Range Extended range is an extra range band  only available to some guns, whose  accuracy and velocity allows them to be  fired (with a chance of success) at longer  ranges. Guns capable of firing at this  range are noted in the equipment data  section.  To hit at extended range always  requires a 6. 3. DAMAGE  Every gun has its high explosive power  rated. The larger the gun, the bigger  the blast – naturally. If a hit is scored  check the gun’s HE rating, given as two  figures, such as 6/4+. This means that  the gun rolls six dice, needing 4+ to  cause a hit.  Damage to Infantry Each hit rolled requires the target unit to  make a cover save. Infantry cannot use  the Fall back! rule against high-explosive  damage, as there is no chance to react. Damage to Deployed Guns Each hit rolled requires the crew to make  a Cover Save. Instead of the hit, if any  of the damage dice were a 6 then the  gun itself must make a Cover save or be  destroyed. Damage to Soft-skinned vehicles Each hit rolled requires the target  vehicle to make a Cover Save or take  a hit. Extra damage will be passed on  to any transported troops, as for small  arms fire.  2.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Damage to Armoured Vehicles The standard high-explosive rating is  not used against armoured vehicles.  Instead, each HE shell also has an  armour penetration value listed.  Cross reference the HE shell’s armour  penetration against the target’s armour  value, just as for an armour piercing  shell. (see Aimed Fire with armour  piercing shells for details). 4. COVER SAVE For each hit rolled the target unit must  make a Cover Save. The cover save is  exactly the same as for Area Fire, but  is repeated here for clarity. Note that  against Aimed Fire make one save  against each hit, not just one save for  the unit. For each save failed, remove  a model. 5. MORALE TEST The target unit might then be requested  to take a Morale test. See the Unit  Morale section for full details of this.  Suffice to say here, any casualties will  cause a Morale test. Example of Aimed Fire with High Explosive  Shell vs Infantry A German Tiger tank opens up with high- explosive shells at a Russian infantry squad,  19" away. First it must observe the infantry,  who are in the open and fired last turn. The  dice roll required is a 2+. It is passed. Next,  the Tiger rolls to hit. At 19" it requires a  3+. The infantry are static, in the open, but  the Tiger moved, so it requires a 4+. A 6 is  rolled and the shell hits.  The Tiger’s 88mmL56 gun is rated as 4/3+.  It rolls four dice and scores three damage.  The infantry get their three cover saves of  6+, and one passes. Two models are removed  as casualties from the blast, and the unit  needs a Morale check.  Example of Aimed Fire with High Explosive  Shells vs Deployed Gun Next turn, the Tiger changes its target to a  deployed 76.2mm Zis3, in a wood line, 33"  away, which didn’t fire last turn. The Tiger  needs a 3+ to see it, and passes. HE shell  loaded, it fires. Rolling to hit, it needs 5+ for  the range, -1 for obscured target. It needs  a 6+ and scores a 6. Kaboom! Good shot.  Rolling for damage it rolls four dice needing  3+, and scores three damage, but one dice is  also a 6, so that’s on the gun itself. The crew  need 5+ Cover Saves for their woods and  make one, so one crewman buys it. The gun  needs a 5+ Covers Save, and fails. The 88  shells demolish the gun itself, destroying it  and the surviving crew are removed too (they  automatically run for the rear). A battle  counter must be taken for the destroyed unit. 1.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A IMED  F IRE WITH ARMOUR PIERCING SHELLS Marder III with PaK 36(r) A rmour piercing or anti-tank    shells are designed to punch  through armour with their velocity  and weight. Lacking the blast of high- explosive, they aren’t much use for Area  Fire (although you can always try), but  instead specialise in Aimed Fire. An  armour piercing shell is probably your  best hope for destroying enemy tanks  and other armoured fighting vehicles.  Follow the steps below. 1. Observe the target 2. Roll to Hit the target 3. Roll for Armour Penetration 4. Target’s Morale test 1.OBSERVATION This is exactly the same as for all forms  of Aimed Fire, and is repeated here for  clarity. 2. TO HIT With the enemy observed, the next task  is to hit them. With armour piercing  shells, this involves rolling to hit. Check  the score required based on the range to  the target, add any modifiers and roll a  single D6. A miss has no effect.   The Rule of 1s and 6s Regardless of modifiers, a dice roll of  1 is always a miss. A dice roll of an 6 is  always a hit. So, even if a moving firer is  shooting at a target 40-50" away, which  moved and is obscured, a straight 6 will  still hit.  1  Extended Range Extended range is an extra range band  only available to some guns, whose  accuracy and velocity allows them to be  fired (with a chance of success) at longer  ranges. Guns capable of firing at this  range are noted in the equipment data  section.  To hit at extended range always  requires a 6. 3. ARMOUR PENETRATION  Every gun has its armour penetrating  power rated on scale of 1 to 15, 1 being  the smallest, lowest velocity weapons,  whilst 15 is for the largest, most  fearsome anti-tank guns.  Likewise, vehicles have their armour  rated from A to O on the front, side and  rear, with A as the thickest protection  and O as the thinnest (but it is still  armour). Any soft-skinned vehicles hit  by an armour piercing shell use the SS  column. Damage to Armoured Vehicles If a hit is scored against an armoured  vehicle, cross reference the gun’s armour  penetration value (at the target’s range)  against the target’s armour rating  (for the facing hit), on the Armour  Penetration Table.  Roll 2D6 and consult  the results. 1. observation table Infantry in the Open Firing   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Infantry in the Open     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Obscured Infantry Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Obscured Infantry  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 4+ Deployed Gun in the Open Firing    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Deployed Gun in the Open   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Gun Firing    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Gun    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Vehicle in the Open Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Vehicle in the Open  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Vehicle Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Vehicle  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Aircraft    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Modifiers If the observing unit has the Scout special rule   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . +1 If the target unit is an Infantry team of three men of less  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . -1 2.  s M all   ar M s   rate   o F F ire Weapon    RoF   Maximum Range   Crew   Special Rifle	 1	 30 "   - SMG	 1(2)*	 10 "   - Light 	 MG	 2	 30 "   1 man Medium 	 MG	 5	 30 "   2 men Heavy 	 MG	 6	 40 "   3 men MG34 	 – 	 bipod 	 mount	 5	 30 "   2 men MG 	 42 	 – 	 bipod 	 mount	 6	 30 "   2 men MG34 	 – 	 tripod 	 mount	 7	 40 "   2 men MG42 	 – 	 tripod 	 mount	 8	 40 "   2 men Tank MG  (bow, co-axial, etc) 	 3	 30 " Pintle 	 mount 	 MG	 5	 40 "   Light Autocannon  (20mm) 	 6	 50 "   2 men   also Light HE Heavy Autocannon  (37mm and 40mm) 	 8	 50 "   3 men   also Light HE Multiple 	 Autocannons	 10	 50 "   2 men   also 2 x Light HE Multiple 	 Medium 	 MG 	 mount	 10	 30 "   3 men   Man-pack 	 Flamethrower	 10	 5 "   1 man   one shot only  .

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Damage to Deployed Guns All deployed guns count as having  an armour value of N. The results for  armoured vehicles remain the same.  Note, there is an additional -1 to hit  with armour piercing shells, because  deployed guns are not normally as large  as vehicles.  Damage to Soft-skinned Vehicles Treat soft-skinned vehicles as armoured  vehicles, except a soft-skinned vehicle  cannot be immobilised, because even if  only immobilised, the crew will abandon    it. So, it counts as destroyed instead. Damage to Infantry If an armour piercing shell is fired at  an infantry unit then it is unlikely to  do much damage, it just isn’t designed  for this job. Roll to Observe and hit as  normal. If the to hit roll is a 6, then the  infantry unit takes one hit, otherwise the  shot misses. The infantry unit still get a  Cover Save against the hit. 4. MORALE TEST The target unit might then be required to  take a Morale test. See the Unit Morale  section for full details of this. Suffice to  say here, a hit, regardless of the damage  result, will require the target to take a  Morale test. 3.

Less   Than   =   Glancing   Hit If   the   2D6   dice   roll   is   less   than   the   score   required   the   shot   glances   off,   doing   no   serious   damage.   The   vehicle   must   still   take   a   Morale   test   for   being   hit   but   not   destroyed.   Equal   to   =   Pinned If   the   2D6   dice   roll   is   a   penetrating   hit,   but   the   dice   roll   is   only   equal   to   the   required   score,   then   the   target   is   automatically   pinned,   not   destroyed.   The   vehicle   must   still   take   a   morale   test   for   being   hit   but   not   destroyed. Double   1   =   Immobilised If   the   2D6   dice   roll   is   a   double   1,   then   the   vehicle   is   immobilised   for   the   rest   of   the   game.   The   vehicle   must   still   take   a   Morale   test   for   being   hit   but   not   destroyed. Schürzen  Plates In order to counter the Red Army’s  widespread use of anti-tank rifles,  the Germans introduced additional  stand-off armour plates called  schürzen  (skirts). A vehicle with  schürzen  increases its side armour  rating by 1 level against any hits with  a penetration value of 5 or less. A  weapon with a penetration value of  6 or more is not affected by the thin  schürzen  plates. Those vehicles which are equipped  with  schürzen  plates have it included  as (-) in their vehicle data. 33 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES ANTI-TANK GRENADES All sides made wide use of Teller  mines, satchel charges and improvised  Molotov cocktails as infantry-borne  anti-tank weapons. Using these was  very dangerous, because you had to get  right up to the enemy tank. An infantry  unit equipped with anti-tank grenades  that has been given the Infantry Close  Assault order, can attempt to attack a  single enemy vehicle. Move the infantry  unit up to within 5" of the target then  roll a D6 on the anti-tank grenade  attack table. An infantry unit equipped with  anti-tank grenades is assumed to have  enough to last the battle and may use  them as often as it likes (or it has men  left to try!). D6   Result 1   Heavy Casualties   Remove 1D3 infantrymen    from the attacking squad,    cut down by defensive fire      during the attempt. This will      also cause the unit to take a      Morale test. No damage is      caused to the target vehicle. 2-4   Casualty   Remove one infantryman from    the attacking squad. This will    also cause the unit to take a    Morale test. No damage is    caused to the target vehicle. Anti-Tank Grenade Attack Table 5   Success – Side Armour   A mine is successfully placed    on the target vehicle. Make    a single Penetration value    6 attack against the vehicle’s    side armour value. 6   Success – Rear Armour   A mine is successfully placed    on the target vehicle. Make a    single Penetration 6 attack    against the vehicle’s rear    armour value. 34 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES I NDIRECT  A RTILLERY  F IRE T he power of artillery cannot be  ignored because, even whilst  the forces on the tabletop are closely  engaged with the enemy, artillery is  a weapon capable of winning battles  on its own. But, despite its destructive  power, artillery also has its limitations,  and certainly cannot be unleashed  indiscriminately. Far more common  on battlefields of the size depicted in  wargames is mortar fire, which also uses  the rules detailed here. In the following  rules the term “guns”, should be taken  to refer to all artillery and “mortars”.  Indirect Fire is the only type of firing  medium and heavy mortars can use.  Targeting artillery and mortars  accurately is a complex mission, only  undertaken by trained specialists in the  form of artillery and mortar observer  teams and senior commanders. Only  units with the Artillery Spotter special  rule can call for artillery fire. A unit  with the Mortar Spotter special rule can  call for mortar fire, as can an Artillery  Spotter.  To use artillery follow the steps below. 1. Request Artillery Fire order 2. Priority Check 3. Communication check 4. Position spotter round. 5. Roll for deviation 6. Fire for Effect 1. REQUEST ARTILLERY FIRE Before any fire can be called up, an  eligible spotter unit must be given the  Request Artillery Fire order.  2. PRIORITY CHECK If the guns to fire are from the  Additional Fire Support section of  the army list, then the spotter unit  must roll a priority check. This can be  either a 1st, 2nd or 3rd priority and  is a D6 die roll. The score needed to  pass the test is given in the Army List.  If the test is passed, then proceed to  a Communication test. Failure means  higher command has not authorised the  use of the guns at this time – hard luck. If the guns to be fired are from the  Artillery section of the army list, then  the priority check is automatically  passed, because these guns are part of  the battlegroup, dedicated to supporting  this battle and awaiting the call from  your observer. 3. COMMUNICATION TEST Next, the spotter must talk to the guns,  to give them their target information.  This is done via radio or field telephone.  The observer chooses how far up the  chain of command he will attempt to call  fire from, with the Communication test  getting more difficult the further up the  chain of command. See the Additional  Fire Support section of the Army List for  the roll required. This dice roll can be  affected by several specialist units, like a  Forward Signals unit, wire team and/or  a dispatch rider. Failure of the test ends  the fire mission due to an inability to get  the right information through in time. Next, roll on the appropriate table to  discover which guns are available. 4. POSITION SPOTTER ROUND Next, place a spotter round marker  anywhere in the spotter’s line of sight,  and within 70" of the spotter. The marker  does not have to be placed on an enemy  unit, just a point on the tabletop, as  artillery fires at a grid reference, not at a  specific enemy target. The marker must  be at least 15" away from an on-table  artillery gun or battery.  5. DEVIATION Next, roll to see how accurate the spotter  round will be. Roll a D6 on the spotter  round accuracy table to see where the  spotter round lands.  Spotter Round Accuracy Table D6   Result 1   Wild. Misses by 4D6" in a    random direction. 2-5   Miss. Misses by 2D6" in a    random direction. 6   Accurate. Misses by 1D6" in    a random direction. To determine a random direction, take  a D12 and allocate one table edge as  12 o’clock. Then, use the D12 result  as a clock face, with the spotter round  heading towards 1 o’clock, 3 o’clock, 7  o’clock, etc. Alternatively, roll a single  D10, its point now indicates a direction.  Other methods of determining a random  direction are also acceptable. Wespe 35 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 6. FIRE FOR EFFECT With the spotter round in its final  position, this will become the centre  point of the ensuing barrage. The spotter  unit can now fire for effect, in which  case the guns will open up. If the spotter  round is positioned badly, then the  spotter unit can cancel the fire mission,  and the guns will hold their fire, ending  the fire mission. FIRING FOR EFFECT Once the guns begin to fire for effect,  the spotter’s order is complete. You  must now order the guns to commence  firing, using the Open Fire! order. Each  gun that will be firing must be given the  order, so reduce the number of orders  remaining by the number of guns that  open fire. Then, follow the steps below. 1.  Determine the number of shots 2.  Roll for Barrage Accuracy 3.  Allocate Direct Hits 4.  Allocate Pinning Hits 5.  Resolve Direct Hits 6.  Resolve Pinning 7.  Rounds Complete 1. DETERMINE THE NUMBER  OF SHOTS Using the Open Fire! order, each gun  will fire two shots. So, the number of  rounds falling is equal to the number of  guns firing x2. Add to this any loader  teams which are assisting the barrage  and pass their loader test. Use one D6  for each shot. COMMUNICATION CHECKS A battlegroup’s radio network is represent on the battlefield by Communication  checks. These are dice rolls that are required to talk to other units, via radio or  field telephone. Often, this will be to talk to artillery batteries to dir ect their fire.  A Communication check is a D6 die roll, requiring a set number to succeed.  Where required the number will be noted, but if it is not noted, then the die roll  is a default 3+.    There are a number of special rules than can affect Communication checks.  Communication units can re-roll one failed  check per turn. A wire-communication unit  can increase a Communication check chance  of success to a 2+, but must be removed  from play once successful. A dispatch unit  will automatically pass a Communication  test, but must be removed from play after  use. Signals Team Above: Gunners clean a 5.5 "  ‘medium’  howitzer near Vaucelle, Normandy.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 2. BARRAGE ACCURACY Roll all the dice on the Barrage Accuracy  Table. Artillery Barrage Accuracy Table 1  Miss The shot is wild, and lands  somewhere where it has no effect  on the battle. 2-5 Pinning The shell does not hit anything,  but lands close enough to harass  and worry the enemy. The round  may Pin an enemy unit. 6  Direct Hit The round lands very close, or  on, an enemy unit, causing death,  destruction and mayhem.  3. ALLOCATE DIRECT HITS Any unit within 10" of the spotter  round marker can be hit in the barrage,  as shells rain down all around. Take  any dice results of Direct Hit (6s), and  allocate them to a unit, starting with  the closest unit to the spotter marker  and working outwards, up to 10" away.  This includes any friendly units, as  the shells do not differentiate between  friend and foe. If there are more Direct  Hits than units in range, then start again,  allocating multiple Direct Hits to the  closest units (ouch!). 4. ALLOCATE PINNING Take any Pinning dice (result 2-5) and  allocate them one at time to a unit,  starting with the closest unit to the  spotter marker and working outwards,  up to 10" away. This includes any units  that have already taken Direct Hits,  so the units closest to the marker are  likely to take the worst punishment.  Again, this includes any friendly units.  If there are more Pinning Hits than units  in range, then start again, allocating  multiple Pinning Hits to the closest units  again. 5. RESOLVE DIRECT HITS Any unit that takes a Direct Hit resolves  damage exactly as if they had been hit  by Aimed Fire from high-explosive  shells. So, use the shell’s HE blast  rating or, if the Direct Hit is against an  armoured vehicle, use the shell’s armour  penetration value against the vehicle’s  side armour value. SPECIAL RULE Harassment Barrage Instead of calling in fire to destroy the enemy with intense barrages, a spotter  can request harassing fire, which affects a wider area, but has less chance of  causing a direct hit. After positioning the spotter marker the spotter can state he  is calling for harassing fire. Resolve the fire as normal, but any Direct Hits must  be re-rolled. If they come up a Direct Hit again, then this still stands. Allocate  Direct Hits and Pinning Hits as normal, but any unit with 15" of the spotter  marker can be affected, rather than the normal 10", as the guns lob shells into the  enemy lines to keep their heads down rather than destroy them. 37 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 6. RESOLVE PINNING HITS Any units that take a Pinning Hit should  be rolled for exactly as if they were  under Area Fire (they are) by the guns.  Cross reference the guns’ high-explosive  size (very light, light, medium and  heavy) versus the target type and roll to  see if it is Pinned. The unit still gets its  Cover save. 7. ROUNDS COMPLETE Once all damage and Pinning is  resolved, the barrage is complete. The  spotter marker is removed, and the  whole process must be run through  again next time the guns wish to fire. MULTIPLE ROCKET LAUNCHERS During the war all sides made use of  multiple rocket launcher artillery, be  it the Red Army’s widespread use of  their Katyusha launchers or the German  Army supported by its Nebelwerfer  batteries. These weapons have a high  rate of fire, but only for a brief time,  before needing lengthy reloading. They  cannot keep up a sustained fire mission  like conventional artillery. To represent their frightening but brief  firepower, multiple rocket launchers  count as firing three times for every shot.  So, instead of multiplying the number of  guns by 2, multiply it by 6! So a battery of two Stalin’s Organs will  fire 12 shots instead of the usual four!  After firing, multiple rocket launcher  artillery must then miss two entire turns  whilst it reloads. So, if a Katyusha battery  fires on turn 1, it won’t be able to fire  again until turn 4.  A US 105mm ‘short’ howitzer  opens fire in Normandy      (US Army Signals Corps)  Example of an Artillery Barrage A German observer team is requesting  artillery fire, using 1st target priority  additional fire support. First, it rolls for  priority, needing a 2+. The roll is a 4, and  higher command have responded to the  request. Next for the Communications test.  The observer must choose how far up the  chain of command to go, and this gives him  the roll required. He’ll go to Division, so  needs a 3+. He rolls 1, and fails, but has a  Forward Signals Unit in the battlegroup so  he can re-roll it. The re-roll is a 5, passing.  Next he rolls which guns are available. A roll  of 3 gets him a battery of two 105mm gun.  He places the spotter round marker and  rolls for accuracy. A 5, it misses by 2D6",  resulting in 7", heading towards 6 o’clock  (in this case short). Despite the miss there  are still three enemy units within 10". The  closest is now a T-34 tank, followed by an  infantry squad and a 45mm anti-tank gun.  Fire for Effect! The two guns will fire four  shots. The four dice are rolled, scoring a  1, 2, 4 and 6. The 1 misses, but there are  two Pinning hits and one Direct hit. The  Direct hit is placed on the closest unit, the  T-34. The Pinning hit is placed on the T-34  then the infantry. The 45mm anti-tank gun  escapes unharmed.  The Direct hit is resolved first. Against an  armoured vehicle, the 105mm gun has a  penetration value of 3, striking the T-34’s  side armour of L. It needs a 9 to penetrate,  and the 2D6 roll result is a 2! The T-34 is  immobilised by the explosion. The Pinning  test is medium HE versus an enclosed  armoured vehicle, needing a 4+. A 2 is  rolled, the T-34 isn’t Pinned. It needs a  morale check for taking a hit, rolls a 5 and is  OK (except it can’t move).  The other Pinning hit is resolved against  the infantry. 105mm howitzers are Medium  HE against infantry, causing Pinning on  a 3+. The roll of 5 Pins them. The infantry  get their Cover save (they are in the open) of  6+. They roll a 1 and fail and are marked as  Pinned. In addition they take one casualty  due to their poor Cover save roll. They do  not need a Morale check for this casualty. Rounds complete, the barrage is over and the  target marker is removed.   38 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES If, during the course of requesting  additional fire support, a test (Priority  or Communications) is failed, then no  guns will fire and the order ends. Note,  that the request for fire support is only  used once it has been accepted and guns  fired. It can be re-used as many times  as necessary in order to get through. A  battlegroup can include multiple fire  mission requests (of different priorities)  if it likes. Also note that the Communications  check can be affected by various  special Communications units. A  Communications unit can re-roll a failed  check. A Wire-Communications unit can  increase the chance of passing a check to  2+, and a dispatch rider can automatically  pass the check.  PRE-REGISTERED TARGET As well as firing at targets of  opportunity, artillery can be pre-ranged  and targeted on a single point, usually a  location of importance to the enemy, or a  suspected route of enemy advance. Once  ranged in the guns already have the  calculations to hit that point, so they can  react quickly and accurately.  A Pre-Registered Target should be  positioned using a sketch map, noting  its location anywhere on the table-top  before deployment. To fire guns at the  Pre-Registered Target, no observer is  required. Do not roll for spotter round  accuracy or Communications, the  barrage will automatically be centred on  that point. Go straight to Fire for Effect!  and resolve the fire as normal.  TIMED BARRAGES Another form of additional fire support  is a Timed Barrage. These are fire  missions pre-arranged before the start of  the battle. The battlegroup commander  must write down which turn his Timed  Barrage will arrive on, after deployment  but before the game begins. He must  also mark the point on a map of the table  that his barrage is aimed at, just as if it  was a Pre-Registered Target.  At the start of the noted turn, the entire  barrage hits, no orders are used and it  cannot be cancelled. Resolve it straight  away, using the standard artillery rules.  A Timed Barrage is a one-use weapon;  once it has been fired, it is completed  and cannot be used again (although a  player may have more than one timed  barrage). TIMED AIRSTRIKE Just as with a Timed Barrage, this is  an air attack mission pre-arranged  before the game, and the battlegroup  commander should write down which  turn his aircraft will arrive on. At the start  of that turn on which the aircraft arrives,  place the model on his table edge.  At any point in the commander’s  turn, the aircraft will race to its target  point and drop its payload of bombs.  This requires no orders and cannot be  cancelled. Resolve the bombing using  the standard rules for air attacks. The  aircraft, its mission complete, is then  removed from the game. Note, the  aircraft can be engaged by enemy AA  fire during the turn by using Reaction  orders as normal.  COUNTER-BATTERY    FIRE MISSIONS Both sides have many guns, and some  of these can be dedicated to seeking out  and harassing the enemy’s guns, firing  over the tabletop. Counter-battery fire  missions can  only  be used against enemy  off-table batteries; they cannot be used  against enemy guns on the tabletop.  If the enemy is going to open fire with  off-table guns, simply interrupt him  and declare a counter battery mission.  Roll a D6; if the result is greater than  the required score (see the Army Lists)  the off-table battery cannot fire, and no  orders are used. Counter battery fire  missions are only used when they are  successful. You may continue to attempt  a counter-battery mission until it works.  You may include more than one counter- battery mission, and any number may be  used each turn. ADDITIONAL FIRE SUPPORT As well as your battlegroup having  its own artillery, guns dedicated to  supporting it or covering the sector  of the front in which your battle is  taking place, there is also other artillery  available via the Army Lists’ Additional  Fire Support. These are off-table guns  (and mortars) which can be called  upon at need by a Forward Artillery  Observer. A battle-group can include  Additional Fire Support as requests, of  either 1st, 2nd or 3rd priority. The higher  the priority, the greater the chance that  higher command will agree to allow  the guns to be diverted away from their  current mission to help you.  If a Priority Request roll is successful,  then you are in luck and there are guns  available. You must now choose how  far up the chain of command to go. The  higher you go, the larger the calibre of  guns is likely to be, but the harder they  will be to communicate with and get  firing in time. This is represented by a  Communications roll, given in the Army  Lists. If the forward observer passes this  roll then there is a battery on standby,  ready to open fire. Roll again on the  appropriate table for the number and  size of the guns that will fire.  Example of an Additional    Fire Support Order A Russian forward artillery observer is  seeking to call in addition fire support.  First, he must make the request. He has  1st target priority, so he needs 2+. He rolls  a 5 and passes.  Next, he must make his  communications check. He decides to call up  to Army level, so needing a 4+. He rolls a 2  and fails. This would end the request, except  he will use the battle group’s forward signals  unit to re-roll that communications die. The  re-roll is a 4 and he is through (thank you  the radio van!). Next, he rolls for which guns  are available. His D6 roll of 5 results in a  battery of 4 x 122mm guns responding.   He  is now ready to fire a spotter round. 39 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Heavy artillery is a weapon that decides  the outcome of wars. It had limited use  (certainly during World War II) as a  tactical battlefield weapon. Artillery’s  main role is to pound the enemy, day  and night, to interdict their lines of  supply, harass his troop movements  and reinforcements and generally make  life in and behind their lines as difficult  as possible. By constantly keeping the  enemy under fire, or the threat of fire, it  has a long term morale sapping effect.  As a tactical weapon, reacting to enemy  moves, hitting his routes of advance or  retreat, or individual firing positions, it  was mortars that best fulfilled the role.  Mortar batteries had the direct links to  units on the frontline and were quicker  to react to rapidly changing battlefields.  The artillery was controlled by specialist  forward observers, of which there were  not that many (as the game’s army lists  allow), and who were too valuable to  be placed directly in harm’s way i.e. on  your battlefield, (it was better to find a  church steeple a few miles behind the  front and have big binoculars). longer barrage causing wide spread  destruction. Lots of 1s, and maybe  only a few rounds actually got fired. Also, different armies had different  artillery practices and doctrine. These  rules try to represent these as well, as  part of the historical character of each  battlegroup, to take into account things  like overall accuracy, reaction times,  ammunition availability, etc. Artillery  is by far the most complex weapon of  the World War Two battlefield to try  and recreate. Firing the guns accurately  was, without the aid of computers,  a time consuming task. It is not the  case that a forward observer could  quickly get on his radio (if it worked)  to his guns and be on target and firing  barrages in a few minutes. Generally,  the guns were pre-aimed at a village  or a town or a hill, not a single tank or  machine gun team. But, to include all  the difficulties of firing artillery would  make it all but useless on our tactical  battlefields, which would be perverse  (if authentic) given its was an army’s  most potent weapon.  The rules try to  offer a flavour of artillery’s impact, not  a simulation of the reality. In a tactical game of platoon and  company-based actions, heavy artillery  is problematic, because once those big  guns get going, your battle is effectively  over. You can’t fight an engagement in  the midst of a big bombardment because,  basically, everybody on the table has to  take cover. Rather than exclude them,  these rules have tried to deal with  this problem in various ways. Firstly,  dedicated artillery guns are expensive  in points and low on BR. Too many and  you’ll rapidly have an imbalance that will  make your battlegroup brittle and prone  to breaking. They are, of course, powerful  weapons in return, but the vagaries of  comms tests and counter-battery fire  mission means they are also an unreliable  one. They become even more unreliable  when bought as additional fire support  (but corresponding far cheaper in points). As with all fire, in the game, each  barrage rolled for isn’t literally the  number of shells landing. It is an  abstraction, to represent a short ‘stonk’  in that general area of the table. How  heavy and accurate that ‘stonk’ is is  really up to the dice. Roll lots of 6s,  and it might well have been a heavy,  NOTES ON ARTILLERY SUPPORT 40 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES M orale is a vital factor in any army,  as men without the resolve,  determination and ‘will to win’ are  unlikely to stand for long in the face  of enemy machine guns and shells.  Self-preservation is almost always the  first priority for soldier on the ground,  and because of this, combatants cannot  always be relied upon to do exactly  as their commanders would wish,  especially when actually under fire.  Also, an army cannot afford to allow  itself to be destroyed in detail; higher  commanders must be aware of how  many casualties they are taking and  whether the potential gains of a victory  are worth the losses being sustained.  This is a decision taken at a higher  rank than the battlegroup commander  represented on the wargames table  (you). This means that, to some extent, it  is beyond your immediate control, and  is represented by the Battlegroup Battle  Rating System (see later). There are two forms of Morale in  Battlegroup. The first is Unit Morale,  which only affects individual units,  based upon their own (bad) experiences  on the ground, such as how many  casualties they have suffered,  prolonged heavy fire, etc. The second  is the battlegroup’s overall Morale and  battlefield situation, which affects the  entire force, and ultimately decides who  wins and who loses. UNIT MORALE Few units will fight to the last man. Most  will rapidly become ‘combat ineffective’  as casualties mount. Some men will just  become too scared to fight on, and will  abandon the battle to seek the shelter of  a ditch and stay there, others will run  for the rear, some may even surrender,  whilst others are just busy tending the  wounded.  INFANTRY UNIT MORALE An infantry squad or team must take  a Morale test if it takes any casualties.  Veteran and Elite units can ignore one of  the ‘pinned’ results on the Unit Morale  table, representing their greater training  and fortitude. An Elite unit may always  re-roll a Morale test if it wishes, making  them hard to break. Last Man Standing Units will rarely fight to the last man;  often they will be given permission  to withdraw before being completely  wiped out, but it is also likely that the  last man will just take to his heels. If an  infantry unit is reduced to a single man,  and is also pinned, then the survivor  runs off (or hides – or both). Remove  him from play, and the unit counts as  destroyed. DEPLOYED GUNS,    UNIT MORALE As with infantry, if a deployed gun (or  mortar team) takes any casualties to the  crew, then it must take a Morale test.  If the gun is destroyed, then the crew  automatically abandon it, and the unit  counts as destroyed. The crew will not  fight on once their weapon is gone. Last  Man Standing also applies to gun crews. VEHICLES, UNIT MORALE Vehicles (or, more correctly, their crew)  must take a Morale test if they take a hit  (from any source) that does not destroy  them. Armoured vehicles do not have to  take Morale tests from hits from small  arms or machine gun fire, as they are  designed to withstand this, and aren’t  too worried about chipped paintwork! AIRCRAFT, UNIT MORALE An aircraft must take Morale test if it  is Pinned, and thus takes damage from  enemy fire.  M ORALE 41 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES UNIT MORALE RESULTS Pinned/Rout-Surrender If an infantry unit is reduced to less than  50% of its starting strength or is already  Pinned, then the unit has had enough  and seeks shelter or runs for the rear,  so remove it from play. If there are no  friendly units within 10", but an enemy  infantry unit is within 10" then they will  surrender. The unit counts as destroyed.  If the infantry unit is still at or above  50% strength, and is not Pinned, then it  counts as Pinned instead. Return to Base -Aircraft The aircraft is driven off by fire and  returns to base. Remove the aircraft from  play, but do not take a battle counter, as  the aircraft is not destroyed. Abandoned The crew of the gun or vehicle make for  the rear as stragglers. The unit counts as  destroyed. Pinned The unit is marked as Pinned. OK The unit still has the determination to  fight on and continues as normal – good  lads!

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A s well as the effect of fighting  on    individual unit’s morale, there  is also attrition on the battlegroup’s  overall effectiveness and the higher  commander’s willingness to press on for  victory. This is represented by the Battle  Rating system. Each unit in a force is given a Battle  Rating (abbreviated to BR in the Army  Lists). This is a number between 0 and  5, and rates the unit’s importance to  the battlegroup – 0 being unimportant,  5 being vital. A unit’s BR is not linked  to its point cost. Some cheap units are  rated as important (like the aid station),  whilst some very expensive units are  not rated so. Before the start of the game  both players should add up their battle- group’s Battle Rating to get a total.  After the number a unit’s BR also  inludes a letter, designating its  experience level: i means the unit is  Inexperienced, r means it is Regular, v  means Veteran, e means Elite.  The battlegroup organisation chart  contains a space for this. In general, the  higher the total, the more effective and  more important the battlegroup.  The game also includes a sheet of Battle  Counters. These counters are numbered  from 1 to 5, with the emphasis on the  middle value counters, with fewer 1s  and 5s.  There are also a few special counters  included, like Air Attack, Breakdowns,  Mine Strikes and ‘Beyond the Call of  Duty’, with some theatres adding new  ones. These special counters are detailed  later or in the supplements. TAKING COUNTERS Before the start of the game, place  all these counters in a single pot to  be shared by both sides, and keep it  somewhere handy. When the fighting  starts to affect your battlegroup, with  casualties, units routing, vehicles  being abandoned and destroyed, and  some other special events, then the  battlegroup commander must take a  random counter from the pot (and no  peeking!).  The player keeps the counter secret,  placing it close to the table, so his  opponent can see how many counters he  has taken, but not the points total. Keep  a running total and when it exceeds the  battlegroup’s total battle rating, then  higher command issue the order to  break contact and withdraw, the battle  is over and you are defeated! The game  ends.  A battlegroup commander must  take a counter under the following  circumstances. • Unit Destroyed If a unit is destroyed, take a counter.  This can be any unit, an infantry  squad, a tank or a gun or tow. If the  unit can be given an order, then you  need to take a counter if you lose  it. Note that several Morale effects,  Surrender/Rout and Abandoned  count as the unit being destroyed,  and thus require a counter to be  taken. • Rally At the end of the battlegroup’s turn  they may rally by taking a counter  and in return removing a D6 pinning  marker from any unit in their  battlegroup. A commander can take  more counters to roll more dice. So,  for two counters, roll 2D6, for three  counters roll 3D6, etc. • Under Air Attack The first time any of your units  come under attack from an aircraft  take a counter. This is in addition to  any counters taken for the damage  inflicted, due to the morale sapping  effects of being strafed and bombed. • Under Flamethrower Attack The first time any of your units come  under attack by a flamethrower,  take a counter. This is in addition to  any counters taken for the damage  inflicted, due to the fear instilled by  such ‘terror’ weapons.  • Senior Officer Destroyed If a unit with the Senior Officer  special rule is destroyed, then take  an extra counter, in addition to  taking the standard counter for a  unit destroyed, because of the extra  distruption caused to the battle-group  in losing its senior officers.   • Out-Scouted In the first turn of the game, the side  with the least scout units has been  out-scouted and must take a counter.  If both sides have the same number  of scout units, no counter is taken. • Enemy Captures an Objective If an enemy unit claims an objective,  then the battlegroup must take a  Battle Counter. • Tactical Co-Ordination Take a counter if a Senior Officer  wishes to use Tactical Co-Ordination  special order.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES OBJECTIVES Each scenario will dictate how many  objectives there are. These objectives  are important locations that need to be  captured. To capture an objective one  side must move a unit (it can be any  unit but cannot be pinned) to within 5"  of it, and there must be no enemy units  (pinned or unpinned) within 10" of the  objective. Once captured the enemy  must take a battle counter.  If the enemy manages to recapture it, by  removing your unit(s) and getting their  own to within 5", then the situation is  reversed, and you must take the counter.  In this way an objective can change  hands many times. An objective must  have been in enemy hands before it  can be reclaimed. It cannot be claimed  multiple times by the same side until the  enemy has taken it, and then lost it!  If, at the end of an enemy turn, a  commander can claim to be holding  all the objectives on the table, they can  claim an ‘all objectives held’ victory,  and instantly win the game, regardless  of the current Battle Rating situation.  So, be warned, objectives are ignored at  your peril.  WIPED OUT    OR PINNED DOWN It is possible to win a game without  breaking the enemy. If, at the start of a  commander’s turn, all their units have  been wiped out or are Pinned, or a  combination of both, and they cannot  issue any orders, then the commander  can no longer continue the battle. They  are defeated, regardless of the current  Battle Rating scores. Game over! TACTICAL LOSS If the game ends, due to time  constraints, without either side having  actually exceeded their Battle Rating,  then the game is a tactical victory for the  side with the highest total BR remaining.  The side closest to 0 BR at the end of the  game has taken a narrow tactical defeat.  There are no draws in Battlegroup.  Should both sides have same amount of  Battle Rating remaining, then the side  that is holding the most objectives is the  winner. If this is also a draw, it is the  side that has inflicted the greater Battle  Rating loss that wins. If, in some freak  circumstance, this is also a draw (man  this game is close), then the side that  out-scouted the other wins. If this is also  a tie... Oh, I give up! RESERVES Many scenarios call for the arrival  of reserves or reinforcements. Often  this will be a random number. Each  unit counts as one reserve, except for  transport vehicles, which still count as  one unit along with any transported  unit(s) inside. This includes tank riders.    Once reserve units arrive place them  on the table edge, and give the unit an  order (or not) from there, as normal.  Being placed on the table edge does not  count as an order or as moving.  The full amount of reserves rolled must  be deployed, unless fewer units are  available. You cannot chose to deploy  ‘some’ reserves.  Multiple reserves unit that arrive along  a road should be placed behind the lead  vehicle, waiting their turn to move up  the road when space allows. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 44 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES SPECIAL COUNTERS The Battle Counter pot will also include  various of special counters. These are  special events that affect the battle and  are played immediately they are drawn,  placing them on the table for both  players to see. AIR ATTACK If you draw an Air  Attack counter, then  there is a chance that  an aircraft is inbound  on a ground attack mission to aid  your battlegroup. Place the counter  on the edge of the table. At the start of  the player’s next turn roll a D6. On a  5+, an aircraft will arrive. Roll again  on the Close Air Support Table in the  battlegroup’s Army List to determine  exactly which type of aircraft it is, and  roll again for how that aircraft is armed.  A failed roll means no aircraft this time.  Note, that if the battlegroup includes a  unit with the Air Spotter special rule,  then the chance of an aircraft arriving  will be increased, as detailed in the  special rules section. BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY Immediately play this  counter on one of your  own units (any unit  you like). It may take  a ‘Beyond the Call of Duty’ test and, if  passed, then immediately be given an  order out of the normal game sequence. CONFUSION The battlefield is a  chaotic place, things  go wrong, people or  units do not act as their  commander wishes, confusion can reign  as shells land (friendly and enemy) and  units can easily be accidently fired on by  their own side. This unpredictability is  represented by the Confusion counter.  Play this counter on any enemy unit. It  must immediately take a Unit Morale  test, just as if it had been hit by fire.  MINE STRIKE On WWII battlefields  mines could crop up  anywhere, and an  unlucky vehicle might  roll over one at any time. Play the Mine  Strike on any enemy vehicle that moved  this turn or last turn (it cannot be played  on static vehicles) and roll a D6 on the  Mine Strike table below. MINE STRIKE TABLE 1  Friendly Fire!  It is not an enemy vehicle but  one of your own that has hit an  uncleared friendly mine. Your  opponent may now place the Mine  Strike counter on one of your  vehicles and roll again on this  table. This can happen repeatedly. 2-5  Kaboom!  The vehicle takes a hit with a  penetration value of 5 against its  rear armour.  6  Critical Damage Regardless of armour, the mine  damages the vehicle so badly that  the crew abandon it. It counts as  destroyed.  AMMUNITION LOW An enemy unit  is running out of  ammunition. This  counter is immediately  played on any enemy infantry unit or  deployed gun. If played on a gun that  has a loader team attached, then remove  the loader team (this does not require  a Battle Counter) and roll on the table  – they won’t hang around with no  ammo left to carry. This counter cannot  be played on a vehicle. Roll a D6 on the  Ammo table. AMMO TABLE 1  No Effect The unit have just enough  ammunition to get by to the end  of the battle. 2-3  Almost Empty The unit can take one more shot  and is then out of ammunition.  They then cannot fire again unless  re-supplied.  4-5  Out of Ammo The unit cannot fire again until  resupplied. 6  Out of Ammunition  The unit is out of ammunition and  quits the battlefield in search of  more. Remove the unit, it counts  as destroyed. BREAKDOWN In battle, moving  off-road and pushing  equipment to its  limits, vehicles can  often suffer mechanical problems.  Immediately play this counter on an  enemy vehicle (but not an aircraft). Roll  a D6 on the Breakdown table. If your  battlegroup contains any vehicles with  the Unreliable special rule you must  play this counter on one of them instead;  see the Unreliable unit special rule for  full details. BREAKDOWN TABLE 1 No Effect  Something’s clanking, but the  vehicle will struggle on until the  end of the game. 2-5 Immobilised The vehicle splutters to a stop. It is  immobile for the rest of the game,  unless it can be repaired.   6  Severe Breakdown The vehicle breaks down badly,  perhaps catching fire as well, and  the crew abandon it. It counts as  destroyed. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 MINE  STRIKE MINE  STRIKE CONFUSION CONFUSION AMMO  LOW AMMO  LOW BREAK DOWN BREAK DOWN BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY BEYOND  THE CALL  OF DUTY A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK A IR  A TTACK 45 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES U NIT  S PECIAL  R ULES M any units have their own special  rules to reflect their role on the  battlefield. These are all detailed here. • Air Spotter (3+) An Air Spotter unit is trained to  direct the close support of aircraft.  If a unit with the Air Spotter rule is  on the table, then the chance of an  aircraft arriving on the tabletop is  increased from the standard 5+, to the  score noted in brackets. In this case it  would be a 3+. • Artillery Spotter Only a unit with the Artillery Spotter  special rule can call in fire from  artillery. They can use the Request  Artillery Fire order. Any artillery  spotter unit automatically has the  Mortar Spotter special rule.  A Forward Observer with the  Artillery Spotter+ special rule may  re-roll the distance dice when rolling  D6s for the distance of scatter. •  Assault Troops Some veteran or elite troops are  trained and equipped for combat  at close quarters. They carry more  SMGs and hand grenades and are  specially trained in hand-to-hand  combat and, more importantly,  have the resolve and courage to use  it! When an infantry unit with the  Assault Troops special rule is given  the Assault order, they automatically  pass their experience test to launch  the assault. Also, instead of rolling a  D6 for their hand grenades, they roll  two D6, and use the highest score.  •  Auxiliary Some units are made-up of former  prisoners of war or unwilling civilian  conscripts, armed and ordered  into fight. Led by a few hardened  NCOs, they had little (if any) combat  training or desire to fight.  Whenever an Auxiliary unit is given  an order roll a D6. On a 1 the unit  fails to do anything and are marked  as pinned instead. A unit that has  the Auxiliary special rule is always  Inexperienced, but they cannot be  given the Close Assault order – they  just aren’t that brave.  •  Bren Teams A British infantry section may detach  its Bren team from the main body of  the squad to operate independently  (usually to give suppressing fire  support to the rest of its section).  This can be done at any time during  a game, or they can be deployed  separately. When a British section is  given an order, simply declare that  the Bren team is being detached. It  now becomes a separate unit of 3  men (with the Bren gun!). The rest  of the section will now complete the  order, whilst the Bren team remains  in place and does nothing. From now  on, the Bren team acts as a separate  unit, so they must be given their own  order, can become pinned, take their  own morale tests and the British  player must take a battle counter if  the Bren team is destroyed.   Once detached, the Bren team does  not benefit from any of its parent  unit’s special rules and they cannot  re-join their original squad during the  game.  A squad may only detach one  Bren team. • Bridging A bridging unit can build bridges  using the Engineering order. Each  Engineering order allows up to 2.5"  of bridge to be placed. Light bridging  units can cover a maximum of 5".  Heavy Bridging units can cover up to  5" per truck in the unit. See Engineers  for full rules. • Communications A Communications unit has powerful  radio or field telephone equipment to  help keep the parts of the battlegroup  talking to each other and to higher  commanders further in the rear.  A unit with the Communications  special rule can re-roll a single failed  Communication check each turn.  • Dispatch If radios and telephones won’t work,  send a messenger. A unit with the  Dispatch special rule automatically  passes a Communications check,  because they have gone in person.  Remove the unit from play once they  have been used. It costs one order to  send a Dispatch unit.  • Elite  (Veteran units only) Some exceptional Veteran units can  be upgraded to have Elite status – the  very best of the best. An Elite rated  unit can always re-roll its Morale  check and also has a superior chance  to pass any Infantry Assault order  test or Beyond the Call of Duty test it  is required to take. • Engineers Units with the Engineer special  rule may attempt demolitions and  mine clearing missions by using the  Engineering order. • Loader Team  Deployed guns and mortars can  sometimes have a loader team  attached to them. This three man  team count as additional crew and  46 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES as part of the unit for targeting and  orders purposes. As well as acting as  an extra source of crewmen to replace  losses, the loader team allows the  gun to reload and fire more rapidly,  because they are extra hands hauling  the ammo. A gun or mortar with a  loader team that is given the Open  Fire! order may attempt to fire three  shots instead of the usual two. On a  roll of 5+, it can fire the extra shot.  Note, the gun must have the Open  Fire! order to use this special rule,  otherwise it cannot be attempted.   • Mortar Spotter Only a unit with the Mortar Spotter  special rule can call in fire from  mortars, usually medium or heavy.  They can use the Request Artillery  Fire order to do this. • Medic A medic within 5" of a friendly  unit can attempt to prevent a single  casualty per turn. Roll a D6. On  a result of 5+, one model is not  removed. If successful the medic is  immediately moved to within 1" of the  affected unit.  • Officer Each officer unit in a battlegroup adds  1 to the orders dice total. So the more  officers, the better co-ordinated and  more effective a battle group will be.  Keep track of how many officers a  battlegroup has.   Officers who are removed from play  can no longer confer their +1 bonus  (it is difficult to command when you  have been shot!).  •  One Man Turret Some older tanks were designed to  take only a single crewman in the  turret, as the tank’s commander,  loader and gunner. This had a serious  effect on a tank’s effectiveness, with  no commander dedicated to finding  targets or giving and responding to  instructions (because he was also  busy operating the gun). A vehicle  with the one man turret special rule  suffers a -1 penalty when rolling to  spot the enemy for Aimed Fire.  • Panzer Ace The Panzer Aces are the very best  tank crews. A Panzer Ace is always  Elite, and gains +1 to hit when using  Aimed Fire with high explosive and  armour peircing shells.  •  Radio Communications Network          The US Army possessed more and  better radios, with even squad  leaders having access to short range  walkie-talkies. This meant command  and communications were generally  better throughout their units. A  US Senior Officer with the Radio  Communications Network special  rule may use his senior officer re-roll  every turn of the game, not just once  per game.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES • Recovery A Recovery unit can tow a destroyed  or damaged vehicle to safety and  back to the rear workshops. See the  Engineers section for full details of  this. • Re-supply A Re-Supply unit can re-supply a  vehicle (or infantry unit or gun) that  has run out of ammunition, by using  the Re-Arm order. • Scout  Reconnaissance units have the Scout  special rule. This confers a number of  bonuses. Often a scenario will have  special deployment rules for Scout  units. Also, when rolling for the first  turn, both battlegroups will add their  number of Scouts to the dice roll.  In addition, before the battle, both  battlegroups’ scouts will have been  hard at work tracking the enemy’s  movements, and might have already  been briefly engaged with the enemy  (or more likely the enemy’s own  Scouts). The side which has the  most Scouts has won this pre-battle  engagement, and has out-scouted  the enemy. Their opponent must  take one Battle Counter in the  first turn because he has lost the  reconnaissance skirmish.  Scout units, being the eyes and ears  of the battlegroup, gain a +1 modifier  to the dice roll when attempting to  Observe enemy units during Aimed  Fire. A unit with the Scout2 special rule is  a superior Scout, usually an aircraft,  and counts as two scouts rather than  just one. All the other rules still apply.  • Senior Officer Ranking higher than the other officers,  this is a more senior commander.  He counts as an officer, so adds 1 to  the Orders dice, but in addition he  may, once per game, re-roll one of the  Orders dice.  If a unit with the senior officer special  rule is on the tabletop when you are  rolling for the number of units to  arrive from reserve (as detailed in the  scenario), then you may re-roll this  dice, because the senior commander  will be making it his highest priority  to get his following units into  position around him. Senior officers also have their own  special order, which only they can  use. If a senior officer is given the  ‘Tactical Co-ordination’ order, he  can take no other action in his turn,  takes a Battle Counter, but may then  attempt to remove a Pinning marker  from a single friendly unit, which can  then be given an Order as normal.  • Sniper Scout Snipers are highly trained specialists.  They operate alone, or in small teams.   A sniper does not have to be removed  if he is the last man and Pinned. Also,  any aimed fire by a sniper counts as  the target being in the open (he waits  for the best shot). A sniper can also  choose the model he removes, be it  the man carrying a special weapon or  an officer.  No Battle Counter is taken  for the loss of a Sniper Scout unit.  They also count as a Scout. • Unique The unit is rare, and a battlegroup  cannot have more than one Unique  unit, regardless of the size of the  game being played. • Unreliable A vehicle that has the Unreliable  special rule is prone to mechanical  problems. If the opposing battlegroup  commander draws a value 1 Battle  Counter, then he may play it on  any Unreliable enemy vehicle.  The 1 counter is now treated as a  Breakdown counter instead. Roll on  the Breakdown table as normal.  • Ura! Ura! Russian infantry still used human  wave tactics, attacking en masse,  and as a result suffered horrendous  casualties – such it was to be a Red  Army rifleman!  A Russian Rifle Platoon may use  the Ura! Ura! special rule. Instead  of giving orders to each squad  individually, activate the Platoon  command squad and declare ‘Ura!’.  Any infantry unit with a model  within 5" of the command unit may  now be given the Top Speed order  without using any further orders.  These units must take their double  moves towards an enemy unit or  their opponent’s table edge. The Ura! Ura! rule may be used to  move support teams, such as machine  guns and light mortars, or they may  remain in place and be given Orders  individually as normal.  • Vehicle Repair These are the battlefield mechanics  and recovery teams, and they may  attempt to repair an immobilised or  destroyed vehicle. See the Engineers  rules for details of this. • Wire Communications Far more reliable than radios, Wire  Communication means that field  telephones can be used. They are  not completely reliable, as cables  are often cut by flying shrapnel, but  a unit with Wire Communications  means any Communication test  is passed on 2+ roll, regardless of  what is actually required. Once  the roll is passed, remove the Wire  Communications unit from play; its  job is finished. 48 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A IRCRAFT   T hroughout the war, most air forces  provided the ground troops with  some form of close air support, as well  as aircraft in other  roles. The aircraft  in the army lists represent those most  commonly used in a ground combat  support role, as fast reconnaissance  units, aerial artillery observers or  fighters, fighter-bombers and bombers  in a ground attack role. AIRCRAFT AVAILABILITY Some aircraft are available to a  commander to include in his battle-  group just as with any other unit. Aerial  reconnaissance aircraft can sometimes  be purchased as reconnaissance support,  and Aerial Artillery Observers can be  purchased as artillery. Most ground  attack aircraft are not available; their  deployment is controlled by higher  commanders above the battlegroup  commander, and as such are beyond  his rank to command. That is not to say  they will not be available to aid him.  The arrival of a ground attack aircraft  is a random event. If, during the course  of the game, a commander should draw  one of the Air Attack Battle Counters  and unpinned, then the chance of an  aircraft arriving improves. Instead of  rolling a 5+, the die roll required is noted  in the unit’s special, Air Spotter (3+)  rule. This is the air controller’s main  role, guiding the pilot to where the  action is, and thus increasing the chance  of air support arriving. ORDERS AND AIRCRAFT An aircraft can be given an order (or  not) just like any other unit. The only  order an aircraft can be issued is the  Manoeuvre and Fire order, so an aircraft  must first move (to anywhere on the  table) and can then Open Fire! AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT Aircraft are fast enough to be able to  move anywhere on the table. Simply  place it somewhere (approximately  10" is fine) from their target. The exact  location is not important, because the  aircraft is always on the move anyway. AIRCRAFT OPEN FIRE! Once in position an aircraft can open  fire. All aircraft firing is resolved in the  20-30" range band, regardless of where  the aircraft is actually positioned. The  usual modifiers are applied to aircraft  firing. It can fire using any of its  weapons as follows. Machine Guns:  Area Fire with small  arms, Aimed Fire with small arms. then there is a chance that an aircraft  will arrive.  Place the Battle Counter on the  commander’s table edge. At the start of  his next turn, before rolling for orders,  roll a D6. On a 5+, an aircraft has  arrived. Next, roll on the battlegroup’s  Close Air Support Table to determine  what type of aircraft it is and what it is  armed with. The tables can be found in  each Army List. Place the model aircraft, on a flying  stand, on the commander’s table edge,  ready to be given an order.  FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS If a battlegroup contains a Forward Air  Controller and he is on the table- top,  PE-2 Dive Bomber 49 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Autocannons:  Area Fire with small arms  or HE, Aimed Fire with small arms,  Aimed Fire with armour piercing shells. Rockets:  Area Fire with high explosive.  Aimed Fire with high-explosive shells.  Bombs:  Indirect Artillery Fire. AIRCRAFT WEAPONRY Machine Guns  Most aircraft are armed with machine  guns. Each aircraft mounted machine  gun has a Rate of Fire of 3. So, an aircraft  with three machine guns would have a  total RoF of 9. Although armed with lots  of machine guns, they don’t carry much  ammunition. An aircraft can only fire its  machine guns three times per game, after  which it is out of ammunition and they  cannot be used again.  Autocannons Many aircraft are armed with  autocannons. These are fired exactly like  other vehicle mounted autocannons.  An autocannon mounted on an aircraft  has the additional advantage of the  aircraft’s own speed, meaning that the  rounds travel at higher velocity than  ground mounted weapons. Aircraft  mounted autocannons gain a +2 bonus  to their penetration value when used  against ground targets. They always  attack a target’s rear (top) armour value.  Autocannons also have three shots per  game.   Rockets The Russian IL-2 Sturmovik, British  Typhoon and American P-47 were armed  with ground attack rockets. All rockets  can only be fired in pairs, but multiple  pairs can be fired in the same attack.  Rockets are highly inaccurate, and  always hit on a 6, regardless of range  and modifiers. A rocket has an armour  penetration value as for guns, and  always attacks a vehicle’s rear (actually  top) armour value. They also have an  HE rating for Area Fire. Bombs Bombs come in three general sizes.  Small, medium and large, but even  a small bomb is still a rather large  explosion!  Each bomb has a  penetration  value and HE rating just like an artillery  shell. Bombs are dropped using the Indirect  Artillery Fire rules. Instead of any  Artillery Spotter placing the target  marker, a Forward Air Observer must  do it, using the Request Artillery Fire  order and then, instead of Fire for Effect,  giving the aircraft the Manoeuvre and  Fire order.  If the target point is not within the line  of sight of a Forward Air Observer, or  one is not present, then the aircraft crew  Bomb   HE   Size   Penetration   HE   Rating Small   Medium   9   7/3+ Medium   Heavy   12   9/2+ Large   Heavy   15   11/2+ UNIT MORALE TABLE D6   Roll   Infantry   Gun   Vehicle   Aircraft   1   Pinned/Rout-Surrender   Abandoned   Abandoned 1   Return   to   Base     2   Pinned/Rout-Surrender   Abandoned   Pinned   OK   3   Pinned 2   Pinned 2   OK   OK   4   OK   OK   OK   OK   5   OK   OK   OK   OK   6   OK 3   OK 3   OK 3   OK 3   Notes 1    Only abandoned if the vehicle is already pinned, immobilised, a soft-skinned  vehicle, or the vehicle has enemy infantry within 10 "  and no friendly infantry  within 10 "  i.e. in close support). Otherwise treat as Pinned. 2    Veteran and Elite Infantry units treat this Pinned result as an OK result.   3   As well as passing the Morale test, the unit is inspired to get into the action. The  unit may immediately attempt a ‘Beyond the Call of Duty’ test.          Sometimes,   in   the   heat   of   battle,   brave   individuals   or   well-led   units   do   things   that   are   above   and   beyond   the   call   of   duty,   heroic   deeds   which   gain   them   promotions   and   prestigious   medals.   A   very   good   Morale   roll   means   a   ‘Beyond   the   Call   of   Duty’   test   can   be   attempted.   First,   the   unit   must   roll   to   see   if   it   will   attempt   it.   Roll   a   D6   and   compare   it   to   the   unit’s   experience   level.   Unless   otherwise   stated   in   the   army   lists,   all   units   have   the   default   morale   level   of   Regular.   Inexperienced   unit:     4+ Regular   unit:       3+ Veteran   unit:       2+ Elite   unit:       2+         If   the   test   is   passed,   the   unit   can   instantly   be   given   a   free   Order,   which   occurs   out   of   the   usual   game   sequence.   Then,   immediately   resolve   that   Order.   If   the   unit   taking   the   test   is   already   Pinned,   then   instantly   remove   the   Pinning   marker,   and   then   issue   the   special   Order.   The   unit   has   suddenly   galvanised   itself   into   action,   or   its officer or NCO has suddenly  inspired   the   men   to   do   something   –   now!   If   the   unit   has   not   already   had   an   Order   this   turn,   a   Beyond   the   Call   of   Duty   order   does   not   count   as   its   Order,   and   it   may   still   receive   another   order   (therefore   gaining   two   Orders   this   turn   –   what   heroes!).  ‘B E y ON d  T h E  C ALL   O f  dUT y’ T E s T s 50 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES must spot for themselves. In this case,  roll for accuracy as normal, but add an  extra D6 to the deviation distance (so  an accurate result would be 2D6 instead  of 1D6).  Other Bombs These are dropped using the same rules  as above, but have different effects once  they hit the ground. Cluster Bombs Sometimes used for ground attacks by  FW-190s, cluster bombs dropped small  anti-personnel bomblets, each only  2kg in weight. Highly effective against  infantry, they lacked the explosive power  to destroy many armoured vehicles. A  cluster bomb has an HE Effect of 10/5+,  but count as Heavy HE when rolling  for Pinning. They have an Armour  Penetration value of 2 and always attack  a vehicle’s rear (actually top) armour.  PTAB Bombs PTAB bombs were an early Russian  attempt to develop cluster bomb  munitions. Each was a 2.5kg hollow- nosed bomblet and 192 could be carried  by a Sturmovik ground attack aircraft.  Dropped from just 200 metres, they  scattered over a wide area. A PTAB  bomb has an HE Effect of 6/5+, but  counts as Medium HE when rolling  for pinning. They have a penetration  value of 6 when rolling for armour  penetration, and always attack a  vehicle’s rear (actually top) armour. DIVE BOMBERS Both the German JU-87D and the Soviet  PE-2 were dive bombers, attacking from  a steep dive. This type of attack meant  that the bombs could be more accurately  aimed than with conventional ‘level’  bombing. When dropping bombs, a dive  bomber may re-roll one of its Artillery  Accuracy dice. The player may choose  which dice to re-roll, but must abide by  the second result. AERIAL OBSERVATION AIRCRAFT Some aircraft were used as spotter  planes for Artillery Observers. These  aircraft can use the Request Artillery Fire  order as well as moving, so the aircraft  can make a normal move (anywhere on  the table) and still spot for artillery in  the same order. Air Artillery Observers  use the same indirect fire sequence as  ground-based observers. AIRCRAFT AND    BATTLE RATING Being under air attack has a  demoralizing affect on ground troops,  and because of this, the first time any  unit in a battlegroup comes under attack  from an aircraft, regardless of the results  of that attack, the battle-group must take  a battle counter.  Conversely, shooting down an aircraft is  a big morale boost and a very obvious  victory. If an aircraft is destroyed, then  two battle counters must be taken,  instead of the usual one for a destroyed  unit.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A NTI- A IRCRAFT  F IRE W ith air attack a constant threat,  a battlegroup will need its own  anti-aircraft defences. Anti-aircraft fire  is always resolved as Area Fire, as the  sky is literally filled with lead in front of  an aircraft, and always resolved at the  weapons maximum range, regardless  of where an aircraft model actually  is on the tabletop (remember it is  constantly moving anyway) and because  fast moving and evading aircraft are  notoriously hard to hit. Only anti- aircraft weapons, infantry small arms  and machine guns, and pintle mounted  vehicle MGs can fire at aircraft. AREA FIRE Aircraft are attacked using the standard  Area Fire rules, simply roll a D6 to see if  the aircraft is Pinned (this isn’t actually  Pinned as for ground troops, instead the  aircraft takes evasive action to avoid the  flak and climbs well out of harm’s way).   Multiple MG mounts Some anti-aircraft weapons with  multiple mounts increase their firepower  and damage. A multiple mounted MG  has its RoF increased to 10, and can roll  twice for Area Fire.  Multiple Autocannon mounts The most powerful anti-aircraft weapons  are multiple mounted autocannons.  These have their RoF increased to 10,  and can also roll twice for Area Fire,  counting as Very Light HE.  DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT If an aircraft is pinned by Area Fire, then  it does not roll a Cover save (there is no  cover in the sky!). Instead, roll another  D6. On a 4+ the aircraft is also damaged  and takes one hit, in addition to being  marked as Pinned. If the damage was  caused by a multiple mounted weapon  then the aircraft takes two hits instead  if one.  AIRCRAFT AND    UNIT MORALE An aircraft that takes any damage must  take a Unit Morale test, just as any other  vehicle that is hit but not destroyed. AIRCRAFT AND    BATTLE RATING If an aircraft is reduced to 0 hits, then it  is shot down over the battlefield. This  is a highly visible and welcome victory.  The commander whose aircraft is shot  down must take two Battle Counters  instead of the usual one, because of the  importance ground troops place on air  support and because the enemy get a  boost from seeing enemy aircraft go  down in flames. 52 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES B ATTLEFIELD   E NGINEERING A s well as getting stuck into the  hard work of destroying the  enemy, there are many other tasks  required on the battlefield by specially  trained Engineer units (also, pioneers or  sappers). Much of this work takes place  behind the lines, but the battlefields  of Kursk also required minefields to  be cleared, obstacles to be demolished  in the midst of battle, whilst damaged  vehicles needed repairing or recovering  and streams, gulleys, anti-tank ditches  and rivers needed bridging. These are  the engineer’s tasks (alongside fighting  the enemy – busy men!). MINE CLEARANCE The Russian defences at Kursk were  heavily sown with mines, and most tank  units had mine clearing pioneer units on  call to race forwards and quickly clear  the route of advance. Some tank units  were led by special remote-controlled  demolition tanks which, when  detonated, also detonated the mines.  To clear a minefield, an engineer unit  with a minesweeper, or a vehicle  equipped with a minesweeper or dozer  blade, must move to within 5" of the  minefield marker. It must then be given  the Engineering Order. At the end of the  Engineering order roll a D6. On a 4+ the  minefield is cleared, remove the marker  from play. On a 1-3 there is still work to  be done – you must repeat the process  and roll again. DEMOLITIONS Blowing things sky-high is one of  the Engineer’s principle tasks. A unit  with the Engineers special rule, that is  equipped with a demolition charge can  attempt to demolish a building, a  bunker, an obstacle, an immobilised  vehicle or up to 5" of linear cover  (like a wall or hedgerow). To set a demolition charge an  Engineer unit must move into  contact with the object it wishes to  destroy (building, bunker, etc). This  must a single, static target. The unit  must then be given the Engineering  order. At the end of the Engineering  order roll a D6. On a 2+, the charge is  set and ready to blow. On a 1, there is  still work needed – you must repeat the  process and roll again next turn.  In any turn after the charge is set it  can be detonated. Roll a D6. On a 2+,  the charge explodes. On a 1, there has  been a failure and the charge is a dud!  A demolition charge automatically  destroys a single target, for example a  bunker, a building (a small one, or part  of a larger one), up to 5" of obstacle,  an immobilised vehicle, etc. Remove it  from play. Any enemy units inside (or  using an obstacle as cover) take a 5/4+  high explosive hit, and are automatically  marked as Pinned for being caught up in  the blast and resulting collapse. German special engineering  vehicles, such as the Borgward  and Goliath, were armed with a  single large demolition charge. The  vehicle is given orders as part of  its command unit’s orders. Rather  than order the command unit itself,  the commander can instead choose to move a single vehicle by remote control.  First the command vehicle must pass a Communication check (2+). If it fails the  remote vehicle fails to act and the order is lost. If it passes, the remote vehicle  may make a normal move.  Once the move is complete, the commander can choose to detonate (or not). Any  unit, defence, minefield marker or building the remote vehicle is in contact with  is automatically hit. The explosion has an HE rating of 10/2+ and an Armour  Penetration value of 13. Any minefield markers within 5" of the exploding  vehicle model are removed from play, as is the vehicle itself. Once detonated,  a remote controlled vehicle cannot be repaired! If you have a model of a crater,  place it where the vehicle once was.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES   BRIDGING Units with the Bridging special rule can  build a bridge across a stream, marsh,  anti-tank ditch or even a river. Light  bridging units can build up to 5" of  bridge (enough to cross a stream, gulley  or anti-tank ditch). A heavy bridging  unit can cross 5" of river per heavy truck  it contains. So a unit with three heavy  trucks has enough bridge building  material to cross a 15" river.  Each full turn spent using the  Engineering order allows an bridging  unit to build up to 2.5" of bridge. So, for  the unit above, to build a 15" bridge over  a river would take six turns using the  Engineering order. VEHICLE REPAIR Units with the Repair special rule can  attempt to fix destroyed or immobilised  vehicles. If a unit with the Vehicle Repair  special rule starts its turn in contact with  a damaged vehicle the unit may be given  the Repair order and attempt to fix it.  An immobilised vehicle becomes mobile  again on a dice roll of 4+.  A destroyed vehicle is fixed and  battleworthy again (and the crew  lurking nearby climb back aboard)  on a roll of 6. A Repair unit may only  make two attempts to fix a damaged  or destroyed vehicle; if both fail, then  the vehicle is damaged beyond the aid  of battlefield repairs and no further  attempts are allowed. VEHICLE RECOVERY Units with the Recovery special rule  can tow away a single destroyed or  immobilised vehicle. If a recovery  vehicle manages to tow a damaged  vehicle off the battlegroup’s own table  edge, then he may replace a randomly  drawn Battle Counter from his stack  back in the pot (his opponent should  choose the counter ‘blind’ –again, no  peaking allowed!).  Each recovery vehicle may only do this  once per game, because once it has left  the table, it can’t come back (and it’s  heading to the rear workshops anyway).   MINEFIELDS A constant threat on the battlefields of WWII,  to mark a minefield place a suitable marker  at its centre point. Any unit moving within  5" of the marker has a chance of setting off  a mine.  Roll a D6 for the unit; on a 3+ it has set off a  mine and takes a 5/5+ HE hit, with no Cover  saves allowed at all, regardless of unit type.  Against an armoured vehicle, the mine has  a penetration value equal to a D6 roll and  always attacks the vehicle’s rear (actually  underside) armour. 54 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES BATTLEGROUP •  KURSK Each vehicle has its own profile, giving details of its  movement, armour and armament, as follows; Off-Road:  the distance a vehicle can move on the table top  (in inches) for a normal move, whilst travelling off-road (or  partially on a road and off-road). Road:  the vehicle’s top speed, travelling flat out whilst it  stays on a road for its entire move. Special:  any special rules the vehicle has for movement,  such as extra mobility or being unreliable. The full rules can  be found in the Unit Special Rules section. Armour:  rated from A to O (with A as the best), each vehicle  has an armour rating for front, side and rear armour. These  are used for hits from the vehicle’s front quarter, left and  right quarter and rear quarter. It also notes if a vehicle is  Open-Topped. The vehicle’s side armour due to its  Schürzen  is given in brackets. Weapon:  the vehicle’s main armament and any secondary  weapons are listed here. The weapon’s full profile will be  given in the gun profiles section. Mount:  how the weapon is mounted, dictating its arc of fire.  Ammo:  the number of shots the weapon has for the  entire game. This is not a literal number, but represents  ‘burst’ of firing at the enemy, given that one shot rolled  for isn’t actually one shot fired. Before the start of a game,  ammunition must be allocated as either HE or AP. So, if a  vehicle has an ammunition capacity of 9, it could allocate  this as 4 HE and 5 AP, or 7 HE and 2 AP. This is entirely  up to the commanding player. Some guns only have one  ammunition type, so they automatically have just that! A  vehicle that runs out of a type of ammunition cannot fire it  again until it is re-supplied.  VEHICLE PROFILES As well as vehicles, all guns also have a profile. Ammunition:  the types of ammunition available for that  gun, usual HE (High Explosive) or AP (Armour Piercing).  Some guns only have one type. HE Effect:  the number of dice and the roll required to inflict  damage with the gun’s high explosive shell, used against  infantry and deployed guns. Expressed as 3/6+, this means  three dice needing 6+.  Armour Penetration Values:  each shell’s value, rated from  15 to 1 (with 15 as the best) when rolling to penetrate a  vehicle’s armour. For HE rounds this is a constant value,  because a shell’s blast doesn’t get smaller over range. For AP  shells the value reduces over range, as the shell’s velocity  naturally drops off. Some longer guns include a penetration  value for the 50-70 "  range band.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK A TTACK  / C OUNTER- A TTACK SITUATION REPORT: An enemy attack has broken through  and is threatening to penetrate deeper  into your division’s rear echelons,  which may force a withdrawal of  troops currently engaged at the front.  Your battlegroup has been held  in reserve to counter just such an  eventuality. You must move fast to  intercept the enemy breakthrough  and halt it. Reconnaissance units  are already tracking the enemy’s  movements and will guide you. Both  sides are on the march, so you must  move directly into battle, there is little  time for preparation. Scenario Type:  Meeting Engagement  TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreed manner.  VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total Battle Rating must withdraw  and loses the battle. Their opponent  is the winner. DEPLOYMENT 1. Determine table corners. Both sides roll a D6 and add the  number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The player with the  highest total chooses which table  corner will be his deployment zone,  his opponent automatically gets the  opposite table corner.  2. Place Objectives Place four objectives on the table. The  side with the most scout units places  the first, then take it in turns. No  objective can be within 10" of another  objective or any table edge.   3. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 4. Deploy Reconnaissance Forces The players take turns to place all  units from their reconnaissance  support. These can be placed  anywhere in their half of the table,  but not within 10" of the table’s centre  line. The player with the most scout  units starts deploying first.  If one side has no scout units, then his  opponent may position his own scout  units anywhere on the table and they  may start on Ambush Fire.  5. First Turn Both players roll a D6 and add  the number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The side with the highest  total takes the first turn. On a tie, the  side with the most scout units wins. If  it is still a tie, then re-roll.  6. Main Force Arrival From turn 2 onwards D6* units are  placed on the player’s table edge,  within 20" of his table corner, as the  rest of his forces arrive on the table.  Continue this until all the forces are  on the tabletop.  * In Company-sized games roll 2D6.  In Battalion-sized games roll 3D6.  20 " 20 " 20 " 20 " 10 " 10 " 56 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK F LANKING  A TTACK SITUATION REPORT The vanguard of your battlegroup  has sighted the enemy, moving  forwards to engage you. You have  recalled your forward reconnaissance  units to assist in the coming battle,  and in the meantime you have been  holding back, waiting for these units  to arrive as a flanking force.  Now all is in place and there is no  further time to waste. Your vanguard  must begin clearing the route of  advance; the rest of the battlegroup is  closing up behind them fast. Scenario Type:  Meeting Engagement   TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreed manner.  VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total Battle Rating must withdraw  and loses the battle. Their opponent  is the winner. DEPLOYMENT 1. Initial Forces  Both sides determine their initial  forces. Both sides have D6 units  chosen from their battlegroup already  deployed on the table. This may  not  include any scout units, but  apart from this restriction, it can be  any units the commander wishes.  All the other units will arrive as  reinforcements.   2. Place Objectives Place D3+2 objectives on the table.  The first objective must be the exact  centre of the table. After this, the  players take turns to place objectives,  starting with the player with the most  scout units. These objectives cannot  be within 10" of each other or any  table edge.   3. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 4. Determine Deployment Zones There are two deployment zones,  each 20" from a table corner. One  player should be allocated a random  table corner, with his opponent  automatically getting the opposite  corner.  5. Determine Flanking Zone Both players roll a D6 and add  the number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The one with the highest  total may choose which of the other  corners (not being deployed on  by either side) will be his flanking  deployment zone. His opponent  then automatically gets the opposite  corner as his flanking deployment  zone.  7. Deploy Scouts All the battlegroup’s scout units (if  any) must start the game deployed in  the flanking deployment zone, up to  20" from their table corner.  8.  First Turn Both players roll a D6 and add  the number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The side with the highest  total takes the first turn. On a tie, the  side with the most scout units wins. If  it is still a tie, then re-roll.  9. Reinforcement arrival From turn 2 onwards D6* units are  placed on the player’s table edge, up  to 20" from their main deployment  zone corner, as the rest of his  battlegroup’s forces arrive on the  table.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK D EFENCE  L INE SITUATION REPORT Your battlegroup’s objective is to  advance and smash through an  enemy defence line. First you must  probe the defences to find the weak  spot, then unleash the full force  of your battlegroup to destroy the  enemy and advance deeper into  enemy lines.  The enemy lines have already been  under heavy artillery fire, and as such  will already be weakened. But it is  likely that reinforcements will have  been dispatched to plug any gap, so  be aware that, should you penetrate  the lines, a counter-attack will be  closing in – destroy it.  Scenario Type:  Attack/Defence TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreed manner.  VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total Battle Rating must withdraw  and loses the battle. Their opponent  is the winner. DEPLOYMENT 1. Determine Table Edges The defender may choose which of  the short table edges the Attacker  must deploy on. He gets the opposite  table edge. 2. Determine the Attacker’s Probing  Force and Main Force Probing Force The probing force must include all  the Attacker’s reconnaissance units.  These will be the first to test the  enemy defences.  It can also include  up to three additional units. These  can be any units the attacker wishes.  Main Force The rest of the attacker’s  battlegroup are his main force.  These begin to arrive from turn 3  onwards, on his table edge. D6*  units arrive at the beginning of  each of the attacker’s subsequent  turns, until they are all on the table.  3. Determine Initial Defenders All the defender’s defences must  be placed in the front line zone; this  is the central third of the table, as  shown on the map. In addition to the  defences, the defender can also place  2D6 units in the front line zone. These  can be any units from his battlegroup  that the commander wishes.  4. Defender’s Reinforcements Any units not deployed in the front  line zone are his reinforcements.  From turn 5 onwards D6* units will  automatically arrive on his table  edge, until all the units are on the  tabletop.  5. Defender Places Objectives Place three objectives on the table.  The defender places two objectives in  the front line zone, and one anywhere  else on the table, but not with 10" of  a table edge or any other objective.    The defender cannot claim an all  objectives secured victory.  6. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 7. Deploy Initial Defenders Place all the initial defenders  anywhere in the front line zone. D3  units may start the game issued with  the Ambush Fire order. 8. Deploy Attacker’s Probing Force The attacker’s probing force units are  placed within 10" of the attacker’s  table edge. 9. Resolve Bombardment A D3 of the defender’s deployed  units are marked as Pinned, due  to the preparatory bombardment.  Allocate the Pinned markers  randomly. 10. First Turn The attacker takes the first turn. Front Line Zone Third of table 10 " * In Company-sized games roll 2D6. In  Battalion-sized games roll 3D6.  58 

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK H IGH   G  ROUND SITUATION REPORT Your battlegroup’s objective is to  clear and capture high ground along  the division’s route of advance. It  will be well defended, and expect  minefields, but in order for the rest  of the division to press its attacks, it  is vital that any threat from the high  ground is quickly neutralised. The  enemy will fight hard to hold their  positions, and aerial reconnaissance  indicates they have reserves ready to  counter-attack.  To deal with the waiting enemy,  your attack will be unleashed in two  waves. The first wave should draw  the enemy’s fire and force them to  commit their reinforcements. The  second wave should move to engage  and destroy those reinforcements and  push-on to overrun the objectives. Scenario Type:  Attack/Defence TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreedmanner. Place a hill  somewhere in the defender’s half of  the table. This is the high ground, the  target of the attack. Place the initial  defences (see below) on the hill or  anywhere within 10" of the hill. VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total battle rating must withdraw and  loses the battle. Their opponent is the  winner. DEPLOYMENT 1.  Determine the Assault Wave First Assault Wave Half the units in the attacker’s  battlegroup must be in the first  assault wave (round fractions up).  Second Assault Wave Half the units in the attacker’s  battlegroup will be in the second  wave. The second wave will enter  via the attacker’s table edge at the  beginning of turn 4. 2. Determine Initial Defenders Half the units in the defender’s  battlegroup will start the game  deployed on the table, defending the  hill. This must include any defences.  All those units not deployed start the  game in reserve. 3. Defences The defender always starts the  game with three defences. These are  always part of the defender’s force, in  addition to any other defences taken  as part of their battlegroup.  MMG Bunker 10" Trench 1 Minefield 4. Place Objectives Place three objectives on the table.  The first is placed on the hill. The  players then take turns to place  objectives, starting with the attacker.  They should be placed anywhere in  their half of the table, but not with 10"  of another objective and not within  10" of a table edge.  5. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 6. Deploy Initial Defenders Place the initial defenders anywhere  in their half of the table. D6 units  may start the game issued with the  Ambush Fire order. 7. Deploy Attacker’s First Wave The attacker’s first wave units are  placed within 10" of the attacker’s  table edge. 8. First Turn The attacker takes the first turn. 9. Defender’s Reserves   From the beginning of turn 4, D6  of the defender’s reserve units  (commander’s choice) will arive on  his table edge. 10.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 1 

PUBLISHING BATTLEGROUP...  is a set  of tabletop wargames rules  for recreating the battles of  World War II, with 20mm  or 15mm miniatures.  This is the core rulebook,  detailing how to play the  game, including such basic  rules as Command and  Control, Movement, Firing  and Morale.    •  COMMAND AND CONTROL The rules use a system of  Orders, putting difficult tactical  decision making at the centre of  the game.  •  FIRING A unique ‘two-tier’ system  for firing involves Area Fire  and Aimed Fire, in which  pinning enemy units can be as  important as destroying them. •  MORALE The innovative Battle Rating  counters system means no two  games will ever play the same.  To play you will also need  a collection of wargames  miniatures, a wargames  table, an opponent and one  of the Battlegroup Theatre  supplements, which provide  all the detail, army lists  and character of specific  battlefields and periods of    the war.  This is not a complete game.
