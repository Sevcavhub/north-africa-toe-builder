## Key Insights for Our Project

### 1. **Official Format is Detailed**

Battlegroup North Africa supplements provide:
- ✅ Complete unit cards with all stats
- ✅ Historical context (battles, divisions)
- ✅ Theatre-specific special rules
- ✅ Points costs (in PDF, not visible in OCR)
- ✅ Painting guides and historical photos

### 2. **Coverage Gaps**

**What Avanti/Torch Cover**:
- Italian forces (comprehensive)
- American forces (Operation Torch onwards)
- German support units (limited to Kasserine Pass)

**What Tobruk Likely Covers** (don't own yet):
- British 8th Army (comprehensive)
- German DAK (comprehensive, 1941-1943)
- Commonwealth forces (Australian, New Zealand, Indian, South African)

**Potential Gaps** (opportunities for our project):
- Additional German DAK formations not in Tobruk
- Additional British formations not in Tobruk
- Free French forces (some in Tunisia)
- Specific historical scenarios not covered in official books

### 3. **Our Database Advantage**

**Official Supplements Provide**:
- 3-5 scenarios per book
- 2-4 divisions per nationality
- Generic force selection lists

**Our Database Can Provide**:
- 50+ historically accurate scenarios
- Every division with exact quarterly TO&E
- Progression over time (1940 Q3 → 1943 Q2 for same division)
- Equipment evolution (Panzer III Ausf D → F → J → M variants)

**Example**:
```
Official Tobruk (estimated):
- 5-6 scenarios
- Generic "German Panzer Company 1941"
- Generic "British Armoured Brigade 1941"

Our Database:
- 15 scenarios just for Operation Battleaxe (June 1941)
- Exact 15th Panzer Division 1941-Q2 TO&E
- Exact 4th Armoured Brigade 1941-Q2 TO&E
- Equipment down to individual PzKpfw III Ausf F vs Ausf G variants
- Quarterly evolution (15th Panzer 1941-Q2 vs 1941-Q4 vs 1942-Q2)
```

### 4. **Alignment Strategy**

**DO**:
- ✅ Use official Battlegroup points costs where available
- ✅ Use official special rules (Avanti Savoia!, Determined, etc.)
- ✅ Match official scenario format
- ✅ Cross-reference our historical data with official army lists
- ✅ Fill gaps not covered by official supplements

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Contradict official statistics (if Avanti says M14/41 is Pen 6, we use Pen 6)
- ❌ Duplicate exact scenarios from official books
- ❌ Use unofficial special rules that conflict with published ones

### 5. **Commercial Product Positioning**

**Official Supplements**:
- Broad coverage of nationality
- 5-10 scenarios per book
- Generic force lists
- $35-50 per book

**Our Potential Product**:

  - 50+ additional historical scenarios
  - Quarterly TO&E evolution (1940-1943)
  - Equipment variant progression
  - Campaign rules linking scenarios
  - $60-80 (premium, data-driven content)
