# CONTINUOUS MODE ACTIVE

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Started**: 2025-10-24
**Mode**: auto:continuous
**Target**: Process all remaining units until queue is empty

## Instructions for Claude

YOU ARE IN CONTINUOUS MODE. This means:

✅ Continue processing batches until the queue is EMPTY
❌ DO NOT stop after "a good number" of units
❌ DO NOT ask user for permission to continue
❌ DO NOT run session:end yourself (script handles it)

## Only Stop If:

1. WORK_QUEUE.md shows 0 units remaining
2. Critical error prevents extraction (file system, etc.)
3. User explicitly says "STOP"

## Current Status

Check WORK_QUEUE.md for remaining units.

If you see this file, you MUST continue processing until the queue is empty.

Delete this file when:
- Queue is empty (416/416 units complete)
- User cancels continuous mode
