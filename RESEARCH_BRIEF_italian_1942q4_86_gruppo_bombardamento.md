## Critical Information Gaps

### Aircraft Variant Specification (REQUIRED):

**What We Need**:
- Specific variant: Serie I, Serie II, Serie III, Serie IV, etc.
- Production batch details
- Engine specification (Piaggio P.XIbis vs other)
- Single vs twin tail configuration

**What We Have**:
- Only "CANT Z.1007bis" (generic)
- General knowledge that Serie I-III had single rudder, Serie IV+ had twin rudders
- Production occurred 1941-1943 with ~450 examples
- No unit-specific variant information

### Operational Detail Gaps:

**Missing for 1942-Q4**:
- Specific bases in North Africa
- Aircraft strength (number operational)
- Combat missions participated in
- Battle participation (El Alamein? Operation Pedestal?)
- Loss/damage rates
- Operational radius in theater
- Supply status

### Tier 1 Source Failure:

**WITW _airgroup.csv**:
- Searched entire CSV
- NO entry for "86° Gruppo" or "86 Gruppo"
- Italian air section present but this unit not included
- Suggests unit may not have been significant enough for game inclusion OR may have different designation

**Comando Supremo (Tier 2)**:
- URL: https://comandosupremo.com/regia-aeronautica-north-africa-1942/
- Status: 404 Error (page not found)
- Previously cited this source in web searches
- Cannot access primary Tier 2 documentation

## What Research is Needed

### Priority 1: Aircraft Variant Identification
**Sources to Check**:
- Asisbiz.com unit pages (if 86° Gruppo has dedicated page)
- Shores, Mediterranean Air War series (specific volumes for 1942)
- Italian language sources (Apostolo, Mattioli, Arena)
- Unit war diaries if available
- Photo evidence of aircraft with visible serie markings

**Specific Question**: Which CANT Z.1007bis variant did 86° Gruppo operate in Q4 1942?

### Priority 2: Operational Context for Q4 1942
**Time Period**: October 1, 1942 - December 31, 1942

**Key Events to Investigate**:
- Second Battle of El Alamein (Oct 23 - Nov 11, 1942)
- Operation Torch (Nov 8, 1942)
- Allied advance after El Alamein (November-December)
- Malta convoy attacks (ongoing)

**Specific Questions**:
- Did 86° Gruppo participate in El Alamein air operations?
- What was their mission profile (naval strike, ground support, strategic bombing)?
- How many aircraft were operational in Q4 1942?
- Were they based in Libya or Italy?

### Priority 3: Strength and Organization
**Need to Determine**:
- Aircraft on strength per squadron (190a vs 191a)
- Aircrew numbers
- Ground crew complement
- Serviceability rates
- Replacement aircraft received

### Priority 4: Tier 1/2 Source Access
**Immediate Actions**:
1. Check if Comando Supremo page has been moved/archived
2. Search Wayback Machine for cached version
3. Locate Shores Mediterranean Air War Vol 2 (covers 1942)
4. Check Axis History Forum for 86° Gruppo threads
5. Search Asisbiz.com systematic unit pages

## Aircraft Technical Context (For Reference)

### CANT Z.1007bis "Alcione" Variants:

**Serie I-III** (Early Production):
- Single vertical tail
- 3x Piaggio P.XIbis RC.40 engines (1,000 hp each)
- Max speed: 283 mph at 15,100 ft
- Range: 1,242 miles
- Service ceiling: 27,630 ft
- Crew: 5-6

**Serie IV-IX** (Later Production):
- Twin vertical tails (improved stability)
- Same engines
- Slight performance improvements
- Better handling characteristics

**Z.1007ter** (Late War):
- 3x Piaggio P.XIX engines
- Improved speed and ceiling
- Entered service early 1943
- Only ~50 produced

**Operational Use in 1942**:
- Four groups and two wings operated Z.1007s in 1942
- Used for naval reconnaissance and convoy attacks
- Participated in anti-Malta operations
- Night bombing missions Oct-Nov 1942

## Recommended Research Strategy

### Step 1: Exhaust Online Tier 2 Sources
1. Asisbiz.com - Search for "86 Gruppo" or "190 Squadriglia"
2. Axis History Forum - Search forums for unit references
3. Wayback Machine - Try to recover Comando Supremo page
4. Regia Aeronautica historical societies

### Step 2: Consult Print Sources
1. Shores, Christopher - "Mediterranean Air War" series
2. Arena, Nino - Italian bomber unit histories
3. Apostolo, Giorgio - "Italian Bombers of WWII"
4. USAAF intelligence reports (if available)

### Step 3: Photo/Serial Number Research
- Search for photographs of 86° Gruppo aircraft
- Look for visible serie markings
- Check squadron codes/markings
- Serial number databases

### Step 4: Cross-Reference with Battles
- Check El Alamein air order of battle
- Operation Pedestal convoy attack participants
- North Africa Italian bomber losses Q4 1942

## Extraction Decision

**Status**: **REFUSED**

**Reason**: Insufficient Tier 1/2 corroboration (15% vs 60% required) and lack of specific aircraft variant information (0 variants vs 1 required minimum).

**Cannot Extract Without**:
1. At least ONE specific CANT Z.1007bis variant (Serie I, II, III, IV, etc.)
2. Operational dates or battle participation for Q4 1942 specifically
3. Strength figures (aircraft numbers)
4. Verified Tier 1 or Tier 2 source documentation

**Why Generic "Z.1007bis" is Insufficient**:
- Schema requires variant-level specificity
- Production spanned multiple series with significant differences
- Twin tail vs single tail affects combat characteristics
- Cannot model aircraft performance without variant detail

## Alternative Units to Consider

If 86° Gruppo cannot be adequately documented for Q4 1942, consider extracting these better-documented Italian bomber units instead:

1. **32° Stormo** (108°, 109° Gruppi) - SM.79 operations
2. **36° Stormo** - Z.1007bis operations (well-documented)
3. **41° Stormo** - SM.79 torpedo bomber operations
4. **9° Stormo** - SM.79 North Africa operations

These units have:
- Confirmed presence in North Africa Q4 1942
- Documented aircraft variants
- Recorded battle participation
- Available Tier 1/2 source material

## Next Steps

**Option 1**: Conduct research per strategy above, then retry extraction

**Option 2**: Select alternative better-documented Italian bomber unit for Q4 1942

**Option 3**: Extract 86° Gruppo for different quarter where documentation is better (if applicable)

**Extraction Protocol Followed**: Hybrid Source Validation Protocol  
**Decision**: REFUSE - Proceed with research or select alternative unit  
**Compliance**: Schema v1.0, Nation value standards, Variant specificity requirements
