## About Discoveries

During unit extraction, agents may find references to units that weren't in the original seed file:
- Parent corps/armies mentioned in division documents
- Sibling units in the same formation
- Additional quarters where a unit was active
- Subordinate units (brigades, regiments) worth extracting

When discoveries are found, they appear here for manual review before being added to the work queue.
