Named after the founding date of the Fascist movement (March 23, 1919), the division participated in the advance to Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Barrani. Following the stall of Italian offensive operations in September 1940, the division withdrew to Bardia fortress where it began preparing extensive defensive positions. In October-December 1940 (1940Q4), the division was engaged in fortification construction, training, and garrison duties at Bardia under XXI Corps command. Morale remained reasonable as troops anticipated resuming offensive operations once logistics were resolved. The division would face its destruction at Bardia in January 1941 during Operation Compass.",
