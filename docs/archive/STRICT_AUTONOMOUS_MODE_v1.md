## Why This Document Was Deprecated

This document contained valuable session management procedures but had significant outdated content:

‚ùå **Outdated Content Removed:**
- References to `session:ready` (replaced by `session:start`)
- References to autonomous timestamp folders (replaced by canonical paths per Architecture v4.0)
- Unit counts (56/213 ‚Üí actual 252/419)
- 12-unit session limit (removed per user directive October 23, 2025)
- Old workflow patterns

‚úÖ **Valuable Content Preserved in START_HERE_NEW_SESSION.md:**
- Checkpoint protocol (automatic every 3 units)
- Crash recovery procedure (4-step process)
- Session end protocol details
- 3-unit batch pattern (without session limit)
- Work pattern guidance

---

## Replacement Document

**Use this instead:** `START_HERE_NEW_SESSION.md`

The START_HERE document now includes:
- Current workflow (session:start, canonical paths)
- Comprehensive session management protocol
- Crash recovery procedures
- Work patterns and stability guidelines
- Up-to-date unit counts and progress
- No artificial session limits

## Historical Note
