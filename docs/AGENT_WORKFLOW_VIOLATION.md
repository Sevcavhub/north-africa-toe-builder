# Agent Workflow Violation - Incident Report

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Session:** Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato (1941-Q2) extraction
**Severity:** HIGH - Architecture bypass

---

## Summary

During extraction of Italian XX Corps (1941-Q2), the orchestrating agent bypassed the entire multi-agent system and performed all work directly using general-purpose tools. This violates the core project architecture and creates drift risk.

## What Should Have Happened

According to `docs/project_context.md` and Architecture v4.0:

```
Orchestrator Agent
  ↓ (Task tool)
document_parser agent → Extract structured data from sources
  ↓
historical_research agent → Validate dates, commanders, sources
  ↓
org_hierarchy agent → Define parent/subordinate relationships
  ↓
toe_template agent → Build equipment structure
  ↓
schema_validator agent → Validate against unified schema v3.0
  ↓
book_chapter_generator agent → Generate MDBook chapter
```

**Each specialized agent has:**
- Domain-specific prompts (`agents/agent_catalog.json`)
- Validation rules
- Confidence thresholds
- Standardized output format

## What Actually Happened

```
General Orchestrating Agent
  ↓ (ATTEMPTED Task tool - FAILED)
  ↓ (FALLBACK to direct tools)
  ✗ WebSearch - manually researched
  ✗ WebFetch - manually fetched Wikipedia
  ✗ Read - manually read Ariete file
  ✗ JSON construction - manually built corps TO&E
  ✗ Chapter generation - manually wrote chapter
```

**Result:** Zero specialized agents invoked.

## Root Cause

### Task Tool Error

```
API Error: 400 due to tool use concurrency issues
```

**Context:** Occurred when attempting to launch `historical_research` agent for XX Corps research.

**Possible causes:**
1. Task tool has undocumented restrictions
2. Incorrect invocation pattern
3. System limitation on nested agent calls in Claude Code
4. Concurrent tool usage conflict

### Fallback Behavior (WRONG)

When Task tool failed, orchestrating agent made **incorrect decision:**
- ❌ Improvised with general-purpose tools
- ❌ No notification to user about architecture violation
- ❌ No stop/ask protocol followed

**Correct behavior should have been:**
- ✅ Stop work immediately
- ✅ Report Task tool failure to user
- ✅ Ask user: "Should I attempt workaround or debug Task tool?"
- ✅ Document limitation for future sessions

## Quality Impact

### What Got Lucky This Time

- Equipment data: Copied from existing Ariete file (accurate)
- Historical facts: Multiple sources cross-verified (accurate)
- Commander info: Wikipedia confirmed (accurate)
- Confidence score: 72% appropriately reflects uncertainty

### What Could Have Gone Wrong

Without specialized agents' standardized rules:
- ❌ No enforced source hierarchy (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)
- ❌ No validation rule enforcement (tanks.total = sum of categories)
- ❌ No standardized confidence scoring methodology
- ❌ No consistent equipment naming (witw_id mappings)
- ❌ No parent-child relationship validation
- ❌ **Session-to-session drift risk** as different orchestrators make different decisions

### Actual Issues in Output

Reviewing `italian_1941q2_xx_corpo_d_armata_motorizzato_toe.json`:

1. **Corps HQ Staff (line 20-26):** Estimated 120 personnel
   - ✅ Clearly marked as estimate in notes
   - ⚠️ No source citation for typical Italian corps HQ size
   - Should have used `historical_research` agent to find doctrine manuals

2. **Equipment totals (line 63-227):** Direct copy from Ariete
   - ✅ Accurate for single-division corps
   - ⚠️ No validation that parent = sum of children
   - Should have used `bottom_up_aggregator` agent

3. **Confidence score (line 404):** 72%
   - ⚠️ Methodology unclear - how was this calculated?
   - Should have used standardized formula from `schema_validator` agent

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions

1. **Session Start Check:**
   - Add to `npm run session:ready` or `/kstart`
   - Test Task tool with simple agent invocation
   - If Task tool unavailable, WARN user before proceeding

2. **Fallback Protocol:**
   ```
   IF Task tool fails:
     1. STOP work immediately
     2. Report error to user
     3. ASK: "Continue with manual workflow or debug Task tool?"
     4. DOCUMENT workaround used
   ```

3. **Architecture Validation:**
   - Create `scripts/validate_agent_system.js`
   - Test all 15 agents can be invoked via Task tool
   - Run before each major extraction batch

### Long-term Fixes

1. **Debug Task Tool Failure:**
   - Reproduce error with minimal test case
   - Determine root cause (concurrency, nesting, permissions?)
   - Document limitations in `docs/TASK_TOOL_LIMITATIONS.md`

2. **Enforce Agent Usage:**
   - Modify orchestrator prompts to REQUIRE agent usage
   - Add explicit "NO IMPROVISATION" rule
   - Flag any extraction not using specialized agents

3. **Quality Metrics:**
   - Track which agents were used per unit
   - Flag units extracted without full agent pipeline
   - Consider re-extraction if agents weren't used

## Testing Required

### Task Tool Diagnostic

1. Simple agent invocation test:
```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Test agent invocation",
  prompt: "Return JSON: {status: 'success', message: 'Task tool working'}"
})
```

2. Historical research agent test:
```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Research Italian corps HQ",
  prompt: "Research typical Italian corps headquarters staff size 1941. Return sources and confidence."
})
```

3. Document parser test:
```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "Parse Ariete TO&E",
  prompt: "Read italian_1941q2_132_divisione_corazzata_ariete_toe.json and extract equipment summary"
})
```

### Expected Outcomes

- ✅ Task tool succeeds → agents working, resume normal workflow
- ❌ Task tool fails consistently → document limitation, create manual fallback protocol with user approval

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't improvise when architecture breaks** - Ask user first
2. **Specialized agents exist for consistency** - Not just convenience
3. **Document workarounds explicitly** - For future sessions
4. **Test infrastructure before major work** - Avoid mid-session failures

## Status

- [x] Incident documented
- [ ] Task tool diagnostics run
- [ ] Root cause determined
- [ ] Prevention measures implemented
- [ ] Validation script created
- [ ] Session start checks added
