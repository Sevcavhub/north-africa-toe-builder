## üîç RESEARCH WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Exhaust Local Documents FIRST
- Search Tessin (German)
- Search British Army Lists (British/Commonwealth)
- Search Nafziger Collection (All nations)
- Search US G-2 / TM E 30-420 (Italian)
- Search Field Manuals (US)

### Step 2: If Data Missing, Use Approved Web Sources
- Start with highest confidence (Feldgrau 87%, Niehorster 82%)
- Cross-reference with at least 2 sources for critical facts
- Document all sources used with URLs and access dates

### Step 3: Mark Gaps Transparently
- If data unavailable after exhausting sources: Mark "Unknown"
- Document which sources were checked
- Set confidence appropriately (e.g., 40% for unknown commander)
- **NEVER guess or hallucinate data**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN SOURCE ISSUES

### Nafziger Collection:
- **Savona Division** (Sept 1941): Lists as "Celere Division" with cavalry regiments
  - **ERROR**: Savona was 55th Infantry Division (15th/16th Regiments)
  - **Cause**: Likely OCR error confusing SAVONA with SAVOIA (1st Celere Cavalry)
  - **Action**: Verify Nafziger data with US G-2 or TM E 30-420 for Italian units

### Feldgrau.net:
- Some pages return 403 errors
- Use cached content or forum posts as fallback

### Niehorster.org:
- SSL certificate issues may occur
- Content is reliable when accessible

---

## üìä CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES

**95% confidence**: Primary official documents with exact match
- Example: British Army List shows "Maj-Gen W.H.E. Gott" commanding 7th Armoured

**90% confidence**: Official manuals with standard TO&E
- Example: TM E 30-420 shows Italian binary division = 2 regiments, 36 artillery

**85% confidence**: High-quality secondary sources with citations
- Example: Desert Rats book cites specific regimental histories

**80% confidence**: Reputable databases with cross-references
- Example: Feldgrau + Niehorster both confirm 15th Panzer composition

**75% confidence**: Specialized sites with domain expertise
- Example: RommelsRiposte provides Afrika Korps tank allocations

**70% confidence**: Multiple secondary sources agree
- Example: 3 web sources confirm unit was present at battle

**Below 70%**: Insufficient data - mark as "Unknown" with gap documentation

## üéØ AGENT USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Italian Division 1940-Q3

**Task**: Extract Savona Division TO&E

**Step 1**: Check local documents
```
‚úì US G-2 Italian OOB 1943: Found unit designation, regiments, history
‚úì TM E 30-420: Found standard Italian binary division structure (1940 TO&E)
‚úì Nafziger Collection: Found but has error (lists as Celere - IGNORE)
```

**Step 2**: Check web sources for gaps
```
‚úì Feldgrau: Italian division organization standards
‚úì Niehorster: 10th Army composition confirmation
```

**Step 3**: Document gaps
```
‚úó Commander name: Not found in any source (mark "Unknown", 40% confidence)
‚úó Exact location Q3 1940: "Libya" confirmed, sector unknown (60% confidence)
```

**Result**: 70% confidence (acceptable with documented gaps)

### Example 2: German Division 1941-Q2

**Task**: Extract 15th Panzer Division TO&E

**Step 1**: Check local documents
```
‚úì Tessin Band 03: Full organization, commander, equipment
‚úì Nafziger Collection: Daily strength returns May 1941
```

**Step 2**: Check web sources for equipment details
```
‚úì Feldgrau: Panzer III/IV variant breakdown
‚úì RommelsRiposte: Desert modifications, actual tank strengths
```

**Step 3**: Cross-reference commander
```
‚úì Tessin: "Generalmajor Heinrich von Prittwitz und Gaffron"
‚úì Feldgrau: "General von Prittwitz" (confirms)
‚úì Niehorster: "von Prittwitz" (confirms)
```

**Result**: 95% confidence (primary source + 2 confirmations)
