**Confirmed Facts:**
1. ✅ **Unit Designation**: "GC II/5" (Groupe de Chasse II/5)
2. ✅ **Unit Type**: Fighter Group ("FF Ftr Grp" / "FFr FB Sqn" - Fighter/Fighter-Bomber)
3. ✅ **Nation Code**: `2` (Allied/British)
4. ⚠️ **Aircraft Equipment IDs**: 723, 564 (NO variant-level specificity)
5. ⚠️ **Personnel**: ~75 total (from CSV columns) - needs validation

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ **Specific aircraft variants** (WITW IDs 723/564 need cross-reference to _aircraft.csv)
- ❌ **Aircraft model names** (e.g., "Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vb", "Bell P-39 Airacobra")
- ❌ **Base location** in North Africa (1943-Q1)
- ❌ **Operational dates** (when active in 1943-Q1)
- ❌ **Battle participation** (specific operations)
- ❌ **Commander information**

## What's Needed (Research Tasks)

### Priority 1: Aircraft Variant Identification
**Task**: Cross-reference WITW equipment IDs to specific aircraft models  
**Sources to check**:
1. `_aircraft.csv` → Find entries for IDs 723 and 564
2. RAF squadron histories → Confirm aircraft types for Free French units
3. French Air Force histories → GC II/5 specific equipment

**Required specificity**: "Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vb" (YES) vs "Spitfire" (NO)

### Priority 2: Operational Context (1943-Q1)
**Task**: Document 1943-Q1 operations in North Africa  
**Need**:
- Base location (airfield name, country)
- Operations participated in (e.g., "Tunisia Campaign", "Battle of Kasserine Pass")
- Dates of activity (January-March 1943)

**Sources to check**:
- RAF Operations Record Books (if available)
- French Air Force combat records
- Allied air operations summaries (Tunisia 1943)

### Priority 3: Unit Details
**Task**: Gather standard unit information  
**Need**:
- Commander (rank, name)
- Personnel breakdown (pilots, ground crew)
- Parent formation (e.g., "Desert Air Force", "RAF 242 Wing")
- Ground support equipment

**Sources to check**:
- Free French air force unit histories
- RAF organizational records (1943)
- Allied air command structure (North Africa 1943)

## Available Sources (NOT YET CHECKED)

### Tier 1 Sources (In Repository):
- ✅ WITW _airgroup.csv → **CHECKED** (unit confirmed, variants missing)
- ⏸️ WITW _aircraft.csv → **NEEDS CHECK** (cross-reference IDs 723, 564)
- ❌ RAF Operations Record Books → **NOT IN REPOSITORY**

### Tier 2 Sources (Need Research):
- ❌ French Air Force histories → **NOT IN REPOSITORY**
- ❌ RAF squadron histories (Free French units) → **NOT IN REPOSITORY**
- ❌ Allied air operations Tunisia 1943 → **NOT IN REPOSITORY**

### Web Sources (Tier 3 - Wikipedia Only for Identification):
- ⚠️ Wikipedia (GC II/5 La Fayette) → Can use for identification ONLY, NOT extraction

---

## Next Steps

1. **Cross-reference WITW aircraft database**:
   - Search `_aircraft.csv` for equipment IDs 723 and 564
   - Determine if these map to specific variants (e.g., "Spitfire Mk Vb" vs generic "Spitfire")

2. **Acquire Tier 2 sources**:
   - RAF squadron histories covering Free French units
   - French Air Force combat records (1943)
   - Allied air operations summaries (Tunisia Campaign)

3. **If WITW aircraft data provides specific variants**:
   - Re-evaluate extraction feasibility
   - Check if 3+ key facts can be corroborated from Tier 1 sources

4. **If WITW aircraft data is too generic**:
   - Source acquisition required
   - Cannot proceed with extraction until Tier 2 sources obtained

## Historical Context (For Future Research)

**Groupe de Chasse II/5 "La Fayette"**:
- Famous Free French fighter squadron (Lafayette Escadrille lineage from WWI)
- Operated under RAF command in North Africa
- Participated in Tunisia Campaign (1942-1943)
- Known for American volunteer heritage (historic squadron name)

**1943-Q1 Theater Context**:
- Tunisia Campaign (November 1942 - May 1943)
- Allied air superiority phase
- Free French forces integrated into RAF/USAAF operations
- Multiple Allied fighter types in use (Spitfire, P-40, P-39, Hurricane)

**Research Question**: What specific aircraft variant(s) did GC II/5 fly in early 1943?
- Likely: Spitfire Mk Vb or Mk Vc (RAF standard)
- Possible: P-40F Warhawk (Lend-Lease), Bell P-39 Airacobra (Free French used these)
- Unlikely: Hurricane (being phased out by 1943-Q1 in North Africa)

## Extraction Readiness Assessment

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Unit designation | ✅ CONFIRMED | GC II/5 (from WITW Tier 1) |
| Specific aircraft variant | ❌ MISSING | Only equipment IDs, not models |
| Operational dates/battles | ❌ MISSING | No 1943-Q1 specifics |
| 3+ Tier 1/2 facts | ❌ INSUFFICIENT | Only 1 fact confirmed |
| **OVERALL** | **NOT READY** | **33% complete** |

## File Paths for Future Extraction

**When requirements are met, use these paths:**
- JSON: `D:/north-africa-toe-builder/data/output/air_units/british_1943q1_gc_ii_5_la_fayette_toe.json`
- Chapter: `D:/north-africa-toe-builder/data/output/air_chapters/chapter_british_1943q1_gc_ii_5_la_fayette.md`

**Schema**: `D:/north-africa-toe-builder/schemas/air_force_schema.json` v1.0

## Conclusion

**EXTRACTION CANNOT PROCEED** due to insufficient Tier 1/2 source corroboration. While the unit is confirmed to exist in WITW game databases (Tier 1), critical requirements are unmet:

1. **Aircraft variant specificity**: WITW provides equipment IDs (723, 564) but NOT aircraft model names with variant detail (e.g., "Spitfire Mk Vb").
2. **Operational context**: No 1943-Q1 battle participation, dates, or base locations from Tier 1/2 sources.
3. **Minimum fact threshold**: Only 1/3+ required facts confirmed from Tier 1/2 sources.

**Research acquisition needed** before extraction can proceed.
