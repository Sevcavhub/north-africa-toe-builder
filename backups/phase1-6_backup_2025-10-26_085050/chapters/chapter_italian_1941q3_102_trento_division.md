## Organizational Structure

Detailed organizational structure not documented in TO&E.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

Division deployed to Tobruk siege sector April 1941, operating under XXI Corpo d'Armata. Static defensive role maintaining siege perimeter. Q3 strength higher than Q4 (pre-Operation Crusader casualties). Full motorization with 480 trucks. Summer heat reducing operational effectiveness. Prolonged siege causing morale strain.
