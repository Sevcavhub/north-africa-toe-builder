### Data Sources

### Research Notes

- Q2 1941: Division in EAST AFRICA (Ethiopia/Abyssinia), NOT Western Desert
- Major operations Q2 1941: Addis Ababa liberation (April 6), advance to Amba Alagi (May 11)
- Redeployment to Egypt occurred August 1941 (Q3), outside this TO&E timeframe
- Artillery re-equipment (18-pdr → 25-pdr) occurred August 1941 in Egypt
- Division composition: 1st, 2nd, 5th SA Brigades (NOT 21st EA Brigade in Q2 - that was Q1)
- Commander: Maj-Gen George Brink (Oct 1940 - March 1942)
- Tier 2 classification due to estimated vehicle/artillery details and missing chief of staff name

## Conclusion

**1st South African Infantry Division** represents a significant formation of the British forces in North Africa during 1941 Q2 (April-June). The unit's organization, equipment, and operational status reflect the challenges and evolution of desert warfare during this period.
