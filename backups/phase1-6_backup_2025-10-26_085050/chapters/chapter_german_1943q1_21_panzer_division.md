Q1 1943: Division in TUNISIA (Kasserine Pass area)

Division severely understrength - organized as battle groups

Reinforced from 4 tanks (Nov 1942) to 91 tanks (Feb 1943)

Commander: Oberst Hildebrandt (from 1 Jan 1943)

Major battles: Sidi Bou Zid (14-15 Feb), Kasserine Pass (19-22 Feb)

Tier 2 classification due to estimated equipment and Kampfgruppe details

Used 1942-Q4 baseline with 1943-Q1 Tunisia delta changes

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
