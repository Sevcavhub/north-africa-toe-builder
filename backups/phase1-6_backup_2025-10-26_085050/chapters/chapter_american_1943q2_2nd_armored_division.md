## Summary

The 2nd Armored Division "Hell on Wheels" spent 1943-Q2 in final preparation for its combat debut as a complete formation. The division moved from Morocco training areas to Algeria (Arzew), then to Tunisia staging areas for Operation Husky (Sicily invasion). Designated as the floating reserve for the Western Task Force, the division completed intensive amphibious training, equipment waterproofing, and ship loading procedures. Command transitioned from Ernest N. Harmon (who took over 1st Armored Division) through brief interim commander Allen F. Kingman, to Major General Hugh J. Gaffey who assumed command May 5, 1943. The quarter involved NO combat operations - purely staging, training, and preparation for the July 10, 1943 Sicily landings at Gela.

- Command transition: Hugh J. Gaffey assumed command May 5
- Moved to Tunisia staging areas (late May)

**June 1943:**
- Marshaling and final preparations in Tunisia
- Tank waterproofing procedures completed
- Ship loading exercises with Navy transport
- Final briefings for Operation Husky

### Command Transition

**Ernest N. Harmon (through April 6, 1943):**
- Led division through Operation Torch and 1943-Q1 training
- Transferred to 1st Armored Division for Tunisia Campaign conclusion
- Brought amphibious training lessons to veteran 1st AD

**Allen F. Kingman (April 6 - May 5, 1943):**

- Would command division at Gela, Licata, and drive to Palermo
- Benefited from months of amphibious training under Harmon

### Sicily Invasion Planning

**Floating Reserve Concept:**
The 2nd Armored Division was designated as the floating reserve for the Western Task Force (Patton's Seventh Army). This meant:
- Division would be loaded on ships offshore
- Ready to deploy to crisis points as needed
- Could reinforce any landing beach encountering difficulty
- Provided Patton with mobile, powerful reserve force

**Actual Deployment (July 1943):**
- Initially held offshore as reserve
- Landed at Gela July 10-11 to support 1st Infantry Division
- Later elements landed at Licata
- Drive to Palermo with 3rd Infantry Division (July 19 onward)

### Equipment Modernization Complete

**1943-Q2 marked completion of major equipment transitions:**

1. **M3 Lee Phase-Out Complete**
   - 15 M3 Lees in 1943-Q1 â†’ 0 in 1943-Q2
   - All replaced by M4 Sherman variants
   - Division now 100% Sherman for medium tanks

2. **M5 Stuart Standardization**
   - 82 M5 Stuarts (87% of light tank force)
   - M3 Stuart down to 12 tanks (final phase-out)
   - Superior automotive reliability for amphibious operations

3. **Modern Anti-Tank Emphasis**
   - M5 3-inch guns increased to 44 (from 36)
   - Obsolete 37mm guns reduced to 36 (from 42)
   - Better capability vs German armor in Sicily

4. **Anti-Aircraft Enhancement**
   - 40mm Bofors increased to 20 (from 18)
   - Improved air defense for amphibious operations
   - Luftwaffe threat in Sicily theater
