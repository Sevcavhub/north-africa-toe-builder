# 2nd Armored Division - Operation Torch (Morocco)

**Nation:** American
**Quarter:** 1942-Q4 (October-December 1942)
**Organization Level:** Division
**Type:** Armored Division (Heavy)

---

## Summary

The 2nd Armored Division participated in Operation Torch as part of the Western Task Force, landing elements at Morocco in November 1942. Only selected battalions from the 66th and 67th Armored Regiments deployed for the landings at Mehedia and Safi. The division saw minimal combat, spending the remainder of 1942-Q4 on garrison and training duties in Morocco. As one of only two U.S. heavy armored divisions (retaining 18 tank companies vs. 12 in light divisions), the 2nd Armored represented significant armored striking power held in reserve during the initial North African campaign.

## Historical Context

### Operation Torch Deployment

**Date:** 8 November 1942
**Operation:** Western Task Force - Morocco Landings

**Northern Attack Group (Mehedia):**
- 1st Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment

**Southern Attack Group (Safi):**
- 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 67th Armored Regiment
- **55 M4 Sherman tanks** successfully disembarked
- Safi chosen specifically because harbor facilities could accommodate medium tanks

### Post-Landing Activities

Following the successful Operation Torch landings, the 2nd Armored Division:
- Remained in Morocco on garrison duties (November-December 1942)
- Conducted training and unit reorganization
- Did NOT deploy to Tunisia combat zone in 1942-Q4
- Saw minimal combat operations during this quarter
- Used time for crew training and desert adaptation

### Heavy Division Organization

**January 1942 Reorganization:**
- Reorganized as "heavy" armored division (maintained throughout WWII)
- **18 tank companies** across two armored regiments (vs. 12 in light divisions)
- Disbanded 2nd Armored Brigade
- Lost 68th Armored Regiment to newly-formed 6th Armored Division
- 14th Field Artillery Regiment reduced to battalion status
- Added 92nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion

**Unique Status:**
Only two U.S. armored divisions retained heavy organization - the 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions. This provided:
- 50% more tank companies than standard divisions
- Greater sustained striking power
- More complex command and control requirements

---

## Tactical Doctrine

### Primary Role
Armored exploitation and breakthrough force optimized for sustained mobile operations with emphasis on tank firepower and shock action.

### Special Capabilities

1. **Heavy Division Structure**
   - 18 tank companies (double the 12 in light divisions)
   - Two full armored regiments vs. three tank battalions in light divisions
   - Superior tank strength for sustained operations

2. **Combat Command Flexibility**
   - CCA and CCB could be task-organized for specific missions
   - Combined arms integration at task force level
   - Independent operations capability

3. **Self-Propelled Artillery**
   - Three battalions of M7 Priest 105mm SPG
   - Maintains pace with armored advance
   - Immediate fire support without deployment delays

4. **Mechanized Infantry**
   - Three battalions in halftracks
   - Keeps pace with tanks
   - Provides immediate infantry support

### Known Issues (1942-Q4)

1. **Limited Deployment**
   - Only elements deployed to combat (66th and 67th AR battalions)
   - Full division capability not utilized in 1942-Q4
   - Combat experience limited to brief Operation Torch landings

2. **Green Troops**
   - First combat operation for most personnel
   - Limited experience with equipment and tactics
   - Crew training still in progress

3. **Heavy Division Challenges**
   - Large, unwieldy organization
   - Complex command and control
   - Later operations would prove difficult to manage vs. light divisions

4. **Equipment Transition**
   - Mix of M3 Lee and M4 Sherman tanks
   - M3 37mm AT guns being phased out
   - Units still adapting to new equipment

### Desert Adaptations

**1942-Q4 Training Focus:**
- Vehicle maintenance in desert conditions
- Sand filter operations and cleaning
- Water supply management
- Navigation in featureless terrain
- Heat management for crews and equipment
- Coordination of dispersed units

**Garrison Period Benefits:**
- Time to train crews without combat pressure
- Equipment maintenance and modification
- Unit cohesion building
- Preparation for potential Tunisia deployment

---

## Supply and Logistics

**Supply Status:** Good - garrison duties only

The division remained in Morocco for training after Operation Torch landings, experiencing no significant supply strain during Q4 1942. With only elements deployed and minimal combat operations, supply situation remained stable.

**Operational Radius:** 250 km
**Fuel Reserves:** 6 days
**Ammunition:** 10 days supply
**Water:** 5.5 liters per person per day

**Supply Advantages (1942-Q4):**
- Based near Casablanca with good port facilities
- No extended operations into Tunisia
- Time for supply organization and training
- Established depot facilities

---

## Weather and Environment

**Quarter:** 1942-Q4 (October-December 1942)
**Temperature Range:** 10째C - 24째C (50째F - 75째F)
**Terrain:** Moroccan coastal plains and Atlas Mountain foothills
**Storm Frequency:** 8 days per month (rainy season)
**Daylight Hours:** 10.5 hours

**Environmental Conditions:**
- Less harsh than Tunisian combat zone to the east
- Training areas around Casablanca region
- Moderate Mediterranean climate
- Occasional heavy rains in winter months

## Wargaming Scenarios

### Suitable Scenarios

1. **Operation Torch - Mehedia Landing (8-10 November 1942)**
   - 1st Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment
   - Opposed beach landing vs. Vichy French forces
   - Combined arms assault on coastal defenses

2. **Operation Torch - Safi Landing (8-10 November 1942)**
   - 2nd/3rd Battalions, 67th Armored Regiment
   - 55x M4 Sherman tanks landed
   - Breakout from beachhead and linkup operations

3. **Morocco Garrison Defense (December 1942)**
   - Full division defensive positions
   - Training scenarios
   - Reaction force exercises

### Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating:** 7/10
**Experience Level:** Green
**Confidence:** 72%

### Special Rules

1. **Elements Only**
   - Only 66th AR (1st Bn) and 67th AR (2nd/3rd Bn) deployed to combat
   - Remainder of division available for garrison scenarios only

2. **Green Unit**
   - -1 to all combat rolls (limited combat experience)
   - First battle penalty for initial engagements

3. **Garrison Training**
   - +1 to morale for defensive scenarios in Morocco
   - Reflects preparation time and favorable conditions

4. **Heavy Division**
   - +2 tank companies per regiment vs. standard light divisions
   - More tanks available but slower to coordinate

5. **Learning Phase**
   - Crews still mastering equipment and tactics
   - May re-roll one failed command roll per scenario (training benefit)

### Historical Engagements

- **Operation Torch landings - Mehedia (8-10 November 1942)**
- **Operation Torch landings - Safi (8-10 November 1942)**
- **Morocco garrison duties (November-December 1942)**

   - Limited combat activity means some tactical data is theoretical/training-based

### Known Gaps

- Specific combat actions beyond initial landings not well documented
- Individual unit performance data minimal (limited combat)
- Equipment losses during landings not precisely recorded
- Training progression during December 1942 not detailed

## Historical Significance

The 2nd Armored Division's participation in Operation Torch marked:

1. **First U.S. Armored Division in North Africa**
   - Pioneer unit for American armored doctrine in theater
   - Lessons learned would inform later operations

2. **Heavy Division Retention**
   - One of only two divisions to retain 18-company structure
   - Unique organizational approach vs. standard light divisions

3. **Training Period Value**
   - Morocco garrison time allowed crucial adaptation to desert warfare
   - Crew training without combat pressure
   - Equipment modification and maintenance procedures developed

4. **Limited 1942 Impact**
   - Minimal combat in 1942-Q4 (garrison focus)
   - Potential held in reserve
   - Would see heavier action in 1943
