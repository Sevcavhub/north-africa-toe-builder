## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
