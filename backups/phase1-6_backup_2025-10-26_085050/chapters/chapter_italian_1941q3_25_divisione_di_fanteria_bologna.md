## Operational Environment

### Environmental Conditions (1941 Q3 (July-September))

| Factor | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Season** | Summer (Q3: July-September 1941) | - |
| **Temperature Range** | 25-40°C (extreme desert heat, Tobruk siege period)°C | - |
| **Terrain Type** | Coastal desert terrain, rocky escarpments, fortified defensive positions around Tobruk perimeter, water sources scarce | - |

**Weather Impact**: Extreme summer heat (25-40°C) causes severe water requirements (7L/man/day minimum). Desert conditions degrade equipment (sand damage to engines, weapons). Heat exhaustion risk high during daylight operations. Dust storms reduce visibility for operations. Siege conditions limit movement to static defensive positions.

### Research Notes

- SCHEMA v3.1.0 COMPLIANCE: Flat structure with top-level supply/environment fields (fuel_days, ammo_days, water_days, operational_radius_km, season, temperature_range_c, terrain_conditions, weather_impact)
- CRITICAL CORRECTION: tanks.total = 38 = heavy_tanks(0) + medium_tanks(0) + light_tanks(38) - EXACT MATCH REQUIRED
- Commander: Generale di Divisione Alessandro Gloria assumed command August 25, 1941 (replacing Mario Marghinotti)
- Parent formation: XXI Corpo d'Armata (21st Army Corps) - confirmed for Q3 1941 Tobruk siege operations
- Composition: 39th BOLOGNA Inf Regt (Caserta), 40th BOLOGNA Inf Regt (Naples), 205th Artillery Regt (replaced destroyed 10th VOLTURNO April 1941)
- Medical units: 66th Surgical Unit, 96th and 528th Field Hospitals, 308th Field Ambulance Unit
- Support: 135th Mixed MT Section, 34th Field Bakery, 73rd CCRR Section
- Personnel: 11,500 (increased from Q2 10,650) - division fully rebuilt and reinforced
- Tank attrition: L3/35 reduced from 40 (Q2) to 38 (Q3) - 2 combat losses, 8 non-operational (heat/mechanical)
- Binary (binaria) division structure: 2 infantry regiments (not 3)
- Semi-motorized AS-type organization specific to North Africa operations
- Supply status deteriorating: Fuel 7 days (down from 8), Ammo 9 days (down from 10) - Axis convoy losses
- Extreme heat Q3 1941: 25-40°C peak summer - severe impact on operations and equipment
- Historical outcome: Division earned two Gold Medals for Military Valor before destruction at El Alamein (November 1942)

## Conclusion

**25ª Divisione di Fanteria 'Bologna'** represents a significant formation of the Italian forces in North Africa during 1941 Q3 (July-September). The unit's organization, equipment, and operational status reflect the challenges and evolution of desert warfare during this period.
