## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Overall Confidence:** undefined%

### Primary Sources

- WebSearch: 2nd New Zealand Division Mareth Line March 1943
- Wikipedia - Battle of the Mareth Line
- Wikipedia - 2nd New Zealand Division
- British 1942-Q4 baseline adapted for 1943-Q1 context

### Known Data Gaps

- Brigade commanders not documented
- Exact vehicle breakdown estimated from 6,000 total
- French force composition (2,500 Senegalese) limited details

### Additional Notes

Q1 1943: Division at MARETH LINE (Southern Tunisia)

Major operations: Left Hook outflanking maneuver (18-30 March 1943)

Division reinforced as New Zealand Corps with French and Greek forces

Casualties: 945 men, 51 tanks lost in March

Terrain: Matmata Hills, Tebaga Gap (mountainous, not desert)

Tier 2 classification due to estimated vehicle breakdown and missing commander names

Used 1942-Q4 baseline with Mareth 1943-Q1 delta changes

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
