## Combat Performance & Lessons Learned

### Successes

- **Logistics Achievement:** Successfully completed 3,000km return convoy to Egypt (15 May - 1 June)

### Challenges
- **Under-Strength:** Division weakened after prolonged combat, required major refit
- **Mountain Warfare Limitations:** 8th Army (including NZ Division) failed to break Axis mountain defenses at Enfidaville
- **Battle Weariness:** 2.5 years continuous combat took toll on personnel
- **Takrouna Difficulty:** 5th Brigade struggled for 2 days in heavy fighting (compared to 6th Brigade's easy success)
- **Reorganization Required:** Major structural change (4th Infantry → Armoured Brigade) needed for future operations

### Tactical Lessons
- **Mountain Terrain Challenges:** High ground defensive positions extremely difficult to assault (Enfidaville experience)
- **Brigade Variability:** 6th Brigade's easy success vs. 5th Brigade's 2-day struggle shows terrain/position impact
- **Refit Necessity:** After 2.5 years combat, division required withdrawal from Sicily invasion to reorganize
- **Reorganization Flexibility:** Converting infantry to armoured brigade demonstrates adaptability
