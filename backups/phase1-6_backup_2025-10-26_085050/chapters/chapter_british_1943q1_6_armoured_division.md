## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Armoured division - spearhead of British First Army final Tunisia offensive May 1943. Division blooded at Kasserine Pass (February), refitted with American Sherman tanks (March), designated spearhead of IX Corps breakthrough to Tunis (May). Captured Tunis 7 May 1943, accepted surrender of German 90th Light Division.

### Special Capabilities

- American Sherman tanks (March 1943 refit) - superior to Crusader/Valentine
- Combat-proven - Kasserine Pass, Tunisia campaign Nov 1942-May 1943
- Elite Guards infantry brigade (replaced 38th Irish Feb 1943)
- IX Corps spearhead - fresh corps for final offensive
- Mobile combined arms - tanks, motorised infantry, SP artillery
- Derbyshire Yeomanry reconnaissance - experienced scouts

### Tactical Innovations

- Sherman tank superiority - 75mm gun, better armor than Crusader
- Combined arms coordination perfected through Tunisia campaign
- Breakthrough tactics - concentrated armour punch
- Capture of Tunis - first Allied entry into Axis capital

### Known Issues

- Kasserine Pass losses (February 1943) - heavy casualties defending Thala
- Sherman M4A2 diesel - less familiar to crews than British tanks
- Transition from 38th Irish to Guards Brigade (February) - new unit integration
- Tunisia mud (Jan-March) limits tank mobility
- Infantry brigade insufficient for sustained operations (only one brigade for armoured division)

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 8/10 |
| **Experience** | Veteran (combat since November 1942, Kasserine Pass February 1943) |

### Special Rules

- Sherman M4A2 superiority: Better armor/firepower than Crusader/Valentine
- Combat veteran: +1 to morale checks
- Guards Brigade elite infantry: +1 to infantry combat
- IX Corps spearhead: +1 to breakthrough operations
- Allied air superiority: -1 to Axis movement/supply in daylight
- Kasserine Pass losses: Division understrength February, full strength March

### Scenario Suitability

- Battle of Kasserine Pass (19-25 February 1943) - Defense of Thala
- Tunisia Campaign January-March 1943
- Operation Vulcan final offensive (6-13 May 1943)
- Breakthrough to Tunis (7 May 1943)
- Surrender of 90th Light Division
- Armoured division vs Panzer/Panzergrenadier

### Historical Engagements

- Operation Torch landings (8 November 1942) - Bone/Algiers
- Run for Tunis (14-28 November 1942) - first Tunisia battles
- Battle of Kasserine Pass (19-25 February 1943) - defense of Thala, heavy losses
- Refit March 1943 - Sherman tanks replace Crusader/Valentine
- Operation Vulcan (6-13 May 1943) - final Tunisia offensive
- Capture of Tunis (7 May 1943) - division enters capital
- Surrender of 90th Light Division - division accepts capitulation
- Tunisia Campaign ends 13 May 1943 - 250,000 Axis prisoners

### Known Data Gaps

- Exact brigade/regimental commander names not identified
- Precise Sherman tank allocation by regiment (estimated 192 total)

- Chief of Staff name not identified
- Exact dates of Sherman delivery/conversion (estimated March 1943)

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
