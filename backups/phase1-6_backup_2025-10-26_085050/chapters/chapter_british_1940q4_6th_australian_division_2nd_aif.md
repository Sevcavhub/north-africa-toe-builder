## Executive Summary

The 6th Australian Division (2nd Australian Imperial Force) entered Q4 1940 as a fully-equipped but untested infantry division completing its training cycle in Palestine and Egypt. Formed in September 1939 as the first division of Australia's volunteer expeditionary force for WWII, the division comprised 16,800 all-volunteer soldiers organized into three infantry brigades (16th, 17th, 19th) with nine battalions, supported by artillery, engineers, and divisional troops.

During Q4 1940, the division transitioned from training status in Palestine to operational deployment in Egypt, assigned to Western Desert Force in December 1940 to replace the 4th Indian Division (transferred to Sudan). The quarter ended with the division poised to enter combat for the first time as Operation Compass began on 9 December 1940.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **All-Volunteer Force:** Every soldier enlisted for overseas service (vs conscription)
- **Mature Soldiers:** Average age 26 years (vs 21 in British divisions)
- **Larger Battalions:** 920 personnel vs 800 in British battalions (four rifle companies vs three)
- **Full Equipment:** 72x 25-pounder field guns, 48x 2-pounder AT guns, 268 Universal Carriers, 1,450 trucks
- **High Morale:** Patriotic volunteers motivated by 1st AIF (WWI Anzac) legacy
- **Untested in Combat:** No battle experience as of December 1940

## Historical Context

### 2nd Australian Imperial Force Formation

The 2nd AIF was Australia's volunteer expeditionary force for WWII, organized separately from the Australian Militia (home defense conscript forces). The 1st AIF had fought with distinction in WWI at Gallipoli, on the Western Front, and in Palestine, earning the legendary "Anzac" reputation. The 2nd AIF sought to continue that tradition.

**Formation Timeline:**
- **September 1939:** War declared, Australian government announces formation of 2nd AIF
- **October 1939:** 6th Division designated as first division of 2nd AIF
- **November 1939 - January 1940:** Recruitment and initial training in Australia
- **January - February 1940:** Division embarks for Middle East
- **February - March 1940:** Arrival in Palestine
- **April - November 1940:** Training in Palestine
- **November - December 1940:** Deployment to Egypt for operations

### Volunteer Ethos

Unlike British regular army divisions or conscript formations, the 2nd AIF was entirely volunteer. Enlistment requirements:
- Age 21-35 (later expanded to 18-45)
- Physical fitness standards (higher than militia)
- Willingness to serve overseas for duration of war
- No married men initially (later relaxed)

This created a force with:
- **Higher Educational Levels:** Many skilled tradesmen, professionals, educated workers
- **Older Soldiers:** Average age 26 vs 21 in British divisions
- **Stronger Motivation:** Patriotic volunteers, adventure seekers, desire to emulate WWI Anzacs
- **Better Physical Condition:** Volunteers passed rigorous fitness standards
- **Superior Unit Cohesion:** State-based recruiting (battalions from same Australian states)

### Strategic Deployment

Australia committed the 2nd AIF to the Middle East for several strategic reasons:

1. **Imperial Defense:** Support Britain against Italy's entry into war (June 1940)
2. **Empire Security:** Protect vital Suez Canal and communications to India/Australia
3. **Training Opportunities:** British facilities in Palestine/Egypt for large-scale training
4. **Historical Connection:** 1st AIF had fought in same theater in WWI (Gallipoli, Palestine)
5. **Distance from Home:** Europe/Middle East closer than Pacific initially (before Japan's entry)

The decision to deploy to the Middle East rather than Europe reflected:
- Britain's strategic priorities (Mediterranean theater, North Africa, Middle East oil)
- Australian government's commitment to imperial defense
- Practical training considerations (desert climate similar to Australian outback)
- WWI precedent (1st AIF had served in Egypt/Palestine 1914-1918)

## Equipment and Weapons

### Personal Weapons

**Lee-Enfield No. 1 Mk III Rifle** (11,200 rifles):
- **.303 British caliber** (7.7Ã—56mmR)
- **10-round detachable box magazine**
- **Effective range:** 550 yards with iron sights
- **Rate of fire:** 15-20 aimed rounds per minute (trained rifleman)

The SMLE (Short Magazine Lee-Enfield) was arguably the finest bolt-action rifle of WWII:
- Fast bolt action (smooth, rapid cycling)
- Large magazine capacity (10 rounds vs 5 in most bolt-action rifles)
- Excellent accuracy
- Robust and reliable
- Simple to maintain

Australian soldiers were exceptional marksmen. Many had civilian shooting experience (hunting, sport shooting). Rifle training emphasized marksmanship, with qualification standards higher than British regular forces. The combination of superior weapon and superior training made Australian riflemen extremely effective.

**Bren Light Machine Gun** (580 guns):
- **.303 British caliber**
- **30-round curved box magazine**
- **Rate of fire:** 500-520 rounds/minute
- **Effective range:** 600 yards
- **Crew:** 2 (gunner, loader/assistant)

The Bren Gun (Brno-Enfield, from Czech ZB vz. 26 design) was the finest light machine gun of WWII:
- Highly accurate (many Bren gunners could hit point targets at 300+ yards)
- Extremely reliable
- Easy to maintain (simple design, few parts)
- Quick-change barrel for sustained fire
- Bipod-mounted for stability

Australian platoon organization centered on two Bren gun sections:
- Each platoon (~40 men) had two Bren guns
- Each section (10-12 men) organized around one Bren
- Rifle-grenadiers supported the Bren
- Tactics: "Bren pins, rifles flank" - Bren suppressed enemy while riflemen maneuvered

**Vickers Machine Gun** (48 guns):
- **.303 British caliber**
- **Water-cooled** (sustained fire capability)
- **Rate of fire:** 450-500 rounds/minute sustained
- **Effective range:** 2,000 yards direct fire, 4,500 yards indirect fire
- **Crew:** 6-8 personnel

The Vickers Medium Machine Gun was a WWI design still highly effective in 1940:
- Water cooling allowed continuous fire for hours
- Indirect fire capability (barrage fire over own troops)
- Fixed fire lanes for defensive positions
- Extremely reliable ("Queen of the Battlefield")

Organization: 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion with 48 Vickers guns in four companies (12 guns each). Companies typically attached to infantry brigades for operations, providing sustained fire support beyond the capability of Bren guns.

### Artillery

**Ordnance QF 25-pounder Gun-Howitzer** (72 guns):
- **Caliber:** 87.6mm (25-pound shell weight)
- **Maximum range:** 12,250 meters (13,400 yards)
- **Rate of fire:** 5 rounds/minute (sustained), 8 rounds/minute (intense)
- **Ammunition:** HE, AP (armor-piercing), Smoke, Star (illumination)
- **Dual role:** Indirect fire support AND direct fire anti-tank

The 25-pounder was the finest field artillery piece of WWII:
- Excellent range (12,250m maximum)
- High rate of fire (quick-firing breech mechanism)
- Versatile ammunition (HE, AP, smoke, illumination)
- Dual role (indirect fire support AND anti-tank direct fire)
- Mobile (towed by trucks, quick to deploy)

Organization:
- **2/1st Field Regiment:** 24 guns (supporting 16th Brigade)
- **2/2nd Field Regiment:** 24 guns (supporting 17th Brigade)  
- **2/3rd Field Regiment:** 24 guns (supporting 19th Brigade)

Each regiment had three batteries of 8 guns each. Australian artillery doctrine emphasized:
- Aggressive forward deployment
- Concentrated fire (all guns on single target)
- Rapid deployment and displacement
- Close coordination with infantry

**Ordnance QF 2-pounder Anti-Tank Gun** (48 guns):
- **Caliber:** 40mm
- **Penetration:** 53mm @ 500 yards, 42mm @ 1,000 yards
- **Effective vs:** Italian M11/39 (30mm armor), M13/40 (30mm frontal armor)
- **Mounting:** Towed or portee (gun on truck bed)

The 2-pounder was the standard British/Commonwealth anti-tank gun 1939-1942:
- Effective against Italian tanks (adequate penetration)
- Portee mounting allowed rapid deployment
- Small, concealable
- Reliable and accurate

Organization: 6th Australian Anti-Tank Regiment with four batteries (12 guns each). Mix of towed and portee-mounted guns. Effective in 1940-41 but became obsolescent as heavier German armor arrived.

**Bofors 40mm Light Anti-Aircraft Gun** (16 guns):
- **Caliber:** 40mm
- **Rate of fire:** 120 rounds/minute
- **Effective ceiling:** 7,200 feet
- **Dual role:** Anti-aircraft AND ground support

The Bofors 40mm was the finest light AA gun of WWII:
- Swedish design, adopted throughout British Empire
- High rate of fire (120 rounds/minute)
- Effective against low-flying aircraft
- Dual-role capability (also effective vs ground targets - trucks, bunkers, light armor)

### Vehicles and Transport

**Motor Transport Total:** 1,450 trucks

The division was fully motorized - all infantry moved by truck (motorized infantry, not mechanized):

- **Bedford 15cwt** (380 trucks): Light cargo, signals, medical
- **Bedford 30cwt** (520 trucks): Infantry transport, primary troop carrier
- **Ford 3-ton** (285 trucks): Heavy cargo, artillery towing
- **Chevrolet 30cwt** (185 trucks): General transport (Canadian-built)
- **Australian-built** (80 trucks): Locally-produced supplements (Holden, Ford Australia)

Operational readiness: 95% (1,378 of 1,450 operational). High readiness due to new equipment, limited operational wear.

**Universal Carriers (Bren Carriers)** (268 total):

The Universal Carrier was a British light armored tracked vehicle:
- **Armor:** 10-12mm (bulletproof only, no protection vs AT weapons)
- **Speed:** 30 mph road, 20 mph cross-country
- **Crew:** 3-4 (commander, driver, gunner, optional)
- **Armament:** Bren LMG or other weapons
- **Engine:** Ford V8 85hp

Uses:
- **Infantry support:** Mobile firepower, ammunition resupply under fire
- **Reconnaissance:** Forward scouting, flank security
- **Mortar carrier:** 3-inch mortars transported and deployed
- **Command vehicles:** Battalion/brigade command posts
- **Pioneer carriers:** Engineer equipment and explosives transport

Australian doctrine emphasized aggressive carrier employment. Carriers often "overloaded" with extra ammunition, water, crew - Australian ingenuity in maximizing capability.

**Motorcycles** (285 total):
- Norton 16H 500cc (145 bikes)
- BSA M20 500cc (98 bikes)
- Norton with sidecar (42 combinations)

Motorcycles critical for communications - dispatch riders maintained contact between units when radio unavailable or unreliable.

## Weather and Environmental Conditions

### Quarter: October - December 1940 (Autumn/Early Winter)

**Temperature Range:**
- **Minimum:** 10Â°C (50Â°F) at night
- **Maximum:** 28Â°C (82Â°F) during day
- **Average:** 18-20Â°C (64-68Â°F)

This was ideal campaigning weather:
- Moderate temperatures (no extreme heat)
- Clear, dry conditions (minimal rain)
- Excellent visibility
- No sandstorms (fortunate - storm frequency only 1 day/month in Q4)

**Daylight Hours:** 10.5 hours average (October 11 hours, December 10 hours)

Shorter daylight in winter limited operational tempo but also provided longer periods of darkness for night operations (emphasized in Australian training).

### Terrain

**Coastal Egypt/Libya Border Region:**

1. **Coastal Plain:**
   - Narrow strip along Mediterranean coast
   - Relatively flat, hard-packed sand and gravel
   - Good vehicle mobility
   - Limited vegetation (scrub, occasional palm groves near wells)

2. **Escarpments:**
   - Steep ridges rising 100-300 feet above coastal plain
   - Rocky terrain, difficult for vehicles
   - Natural defensive positions
   - Limited passes for vehicle movement

3. **Rocky Desert (Inland):**
   - Hard-packed surface with rock outcrops
   - Good vehicle mobility (better than sand)
   - Navigational challenges (few landmarks)
   - Extreme temperature variation (day/night)

4. **Fortified Positions:**
   - Italian-built fortifications at Bardia, Tobruk, other locations
   - Concrete bunkers, anti-tank ditches, wire obstacles, minefields
   - Positioned to control passes through escarpments and coastal roads

### Environmental Challenges

**Water Scarcity:**
- Few natural water sources (wells limited, often brackish)
- Division relied on water convoys from Egypt
- Water discipline critical: 4.5 liters/man/day vs 15 liters theoretical requirement
- Dehydration risk managed through training and discipline

**Desert Conditions:**
- Sand and dust: engine wear, weapon fouling, visibility reduction
- Heat (even moderate): physical exhaustion risk, vehicle overheating
- Navigation: few landmarks, reliance on sun compass and dead reckoning
- Medical: desert sores, dysentery, heat exhaustion risks

**Australian Adaptation:**

Australians adapted well to desert conditions:
- Outback experience (many soldiers from rural Australia)
- Physical fitness and resilience
- Water discipline training (learned to operate on minimal water)
- Vehicle maintenance skills (improvisation and repair)
- Navigation skills (sun compass, star navigation)

---

## Combat Status and Readiness

### Operational Readiness: 92%

**Strengths:**
- Full personnel establishment (16,800 all ranks)
- Full equipment (72 artillery, 48 AT guns, 268 carriers, 1,450 trucks)
- Excellent morale (volunteer force, high motivation)
- Thorough training (9 months Palestine, 1 month Egypt desert training)
- Experienced leadership (WWI veteran commanders)
- Superior physical fitness (average age 26, excellent condition)
- High unit cohesion (state-based recruiting)

**Limitations:**
- No combat experience (untested in battle)
- Limited tank coordination training (no organic armor)
- Newest battalion (2/11th) less training than others
- Vehicle maintenance learning curve (desert conditions)
- Air-ground coordination developing

### Morale: Excellent (8/10)

Factors contributing to high morale:

1. **Volunteer Ethos:** Every soldier chose to enlist
2. **Patriotic Motivation:** Desire to serve Australia and Empire
3. **Anzac Legacy:** Pride in 1st AIF (WWI) heritage
4. **Unit Cohesion:** State-based recruiting, soldiers knew each other
5. **Leadership:** Respected commanders (Mackay, brigade commanders)
6. **Equipment:** Full modern equipment, well-supplied
7. **Training Success:** Confidence from thorough preparation
8. **Anticipation:** Eagerness to prove themselves in combat

Negative factors (minimal):
- Distance from home (Australia 12,000 miles away)
- Limited combat experience (some anxiety about first battle)
- Uncertainty about when/where committed

Overall, morale was exceptional for an untested division.

### Experience Level: Regular

- **Not Green:** 9 months intensive training eliminated "raw recruit" status
- **Not Veteran:** No combat experience as of December 1940
- **Regular:** Well-trained, well-equipped, professional soldiers

Classification as "Regular" reflects:
- Thorough training completion
- Proficiency in individual and unit skills
- Combined arms coordination capability
- Desert acclimatization
- But lacking combat experience to qualify as "Veteran"

First combat (Bardia, January 1941) would elevate division to Veteran status after successful fortress assault.

**Phase 2 - Approach March:**
- Night movement to assembly areas
- Silent approach (no lights, noise discipline)
- Position troops in covered areas (wadis, dead ground)
- Artillery and tanks move to support positions

**Phase 3 - Artillery Preparation:**
- Massive artillery bombardment at dawn
- Focus on identified strongpoints and bunkers
- Smoke screens to blind enemy observation
- Naval gunfire support if available (coastal targets)

**Phase 4 - Breach:**
- Infantry assault led by engineers with Bangalore torpedoes
- Wire obstacles blown, lanes marked
- Matilda tanks lead through breach (impervious to Italian AT guns)
- Infantry follow tanks into enemy position

**Phase 5 - Exploitation:**
- Rapid expansion of breach
- Roll up enemy positions from flank
- Reserve battalions exploit into depth
- Isolate and destroy remaining strongpoints

**Phase 6 - Consolidation:**
- Secure captured positions
- Reorganize units
- Prepare for counterattack
- Process prisoners and captured equipment

This doctrine, developed through training and planning in Q4 1940, would prove devastatingly effective at Bardia and Tobruk in January 1941.

## Conclusion

The 6th Australian Division (2nd AIF) in Q4 1940 was an untested but superbly prepared infantry division poised on the brink of combat. With 16,800 all-volunteer soldiers organized into three infantry brigades, supported by modern artillery and divisional troops, the division represented Australia's commitment to imperial defense and continuation of the legendary Anzac tradition from WWI.

**Key Achievements Q4 1940:**
- Completed comprehensive 9-month training cycle
- Deployed from Palestine to Egypt operational theater
- Achieved desert acclimatization and environmental adaptation
- Integrated into Western Desert Force
- Prepared fortress assault tactics for upcoming operations
- Maintained excellent morale and operational readiness

**Status End of Quarter:**
- **Personnel:** 16,800 all ranks (full establishment)
- **Equipment:** 72x 25-pdrs, 48x 2-pdrs, 268 carriers, 1,450 trucks (95% operational)
- **Morale:** Excellent (8/10)
- **Experience:** Regular (well-trained, untested in combat)
- **Readiness:** 92% (fully prepared for operations)

The division would enter combat in January 1941 (Q1) and prove itself one of the finest assault formations of WWII, capturing three Italian fortresses in six weeks and taking 70,000+ prisoners. But in Q4 1940, it remained a promise unfulfilled - a division of volunteers, thoroughly trained, excellently equipped, eager to prove themselves worthy of the Anzac legacy.

As the quarter ended with Operation Compass beginning on 9 December 1940, the 6th Australian Division stood ready. Within weeks, it would become legendary.
