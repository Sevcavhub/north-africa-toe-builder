- Major General Omar Bradley (II Corps commander) rejected bypassing the hill
- Division planned coordinated assault with artillery, armor, and infantry

**Battle of Hill 609 (April 20 - May 1, 1943)**

**Phase 1 - Initial Assault (April 20-27):**
- 133rd and 135th Infantry Regiments launched attacks from south and east
- Steep slopes, German fortifications, and cross-fire made advance extremely difficult
- Artillery support from all four divisional artillery battalions plus corps assets
- Attached tank destroyers provided direct fire support
- Slow, costly progress measuring yards per day

**Phase 2 - Summit Assault (April 28-30):**
- 168th Infantry Regiment committed for final push - their redemption after Faid Pass
- Coordinated night infiltration attacks
- German counterattacks beaten back with artillery support
- **April 30:** 168th Regiment reaches summit of Hill 609

## Tactical Doctrine

### Operational Role
Veteran US Infantry Division configured for:
- **Assault infantry operations** - proven capability at Hill 609
- **Mountain warfare** - expertise developed through Tunisia Campaign
- **Combined arms coordination** - artillery, armor, and infantry integration
- **Amphibious operations** - training for Sicily invasion
- **Fortification assault** - experienced in reducing German defensive positions

### Special Capabilities
- **Mountain Warfare Expertise:** Hill 609 assault demonstrated world-class capability in steep terrain operations under fire
- **Superior Combined Arms Coordination:** Lessons from Faid Pass disaster fully integrated into doctrine and practice
- **Night Operations:** Proven capability in coordinated night infiltration attacks
- **Engineer-Infantry Coordination:** 109th Engineers expert in obstacle reduction, mine clearing, and fortification assault
- **Coordination with Attached Armor:** Experienced working with tank and tank destroyer battalions
- **Artillery-Infantry Integration:** Divisional artillery and infantry achieved exceptional coordination levels

### Tactical Innovations
- **Use of Tank Destroyers in Direct Infantry Support:** Hill 609 demonstrated TDs could provide direct fire against fortified positions
- **Coordinated Artillery-Infantry Night Assaults:** Night infiltration covered by pre-planned artillery fires
- **Infiltration Tactics for Mountain Warfare:** Small unit infiltration along ridge lines and draws
- **Improved Anti-Tank Defense Integration:** Lessons from Faid Pass fully incorporated
- **Combined Engineer-Infantry Assault Techniques:** Engineers and infantry operating as integrated teams for fortified positions

### Known Issues
- **Limited Organic Anti-Tank Capability:** Standard 37mm and 57mm AT guns insufficient against heavier German armor - dependent on attached TD battalions
- **No Organic Armor:** Requires corps-level tank battalion attachment for armored support
- **Equipment Wear:** Vehicles and weapons requiring maintenance and replacement after intensive Tunisia fighting
- **Amphibious Training Required:** Division transitioning from mountain warfare to amphibious operations for Sicily

### Lessons Learned (Hill 609)
1. **Artillery Dominance Critical:** Overwhelming artillery support enabled infantry assault on fortified heights
2. **Engineer Integration Essential:** Engineers clearing obstacles and mines immediately behind advancing infantry
3. **Night Operations Advantage:** Night infiltration reduced German artillery effectiveness
4. **Tank Destroyer Utility:** TDs excellent for direct fire support against fortifications
5. **Small Unit Leadership:** Squad and platoon leaders critical for mountain warfare success
6. **Persistence Wins:** Slow, steady advance with consolidation superior to hasty attacks

## Historical Significance

### The Transformation of the 34th Infantry Division

The period from April to June 1943 represents the complete transformation of the 34th Infantry Division from inexperienced, shell-shocked troops to combat-effective veterans.

**February 1943:** Disaster at Faid Pass
- 168th Regiment overrun and destroyed (50% casualties)
- Division credibility questioned
- Morale severely damaged
- Tactical competence doubted

**May 1943:** Triumph at Hill 609
- Division captured "impregnable" German position
- First clear American victory in Tunisia
- 168th Regiment led final assault - complete redemption
- Tactical expertise proven
- Division earned "Regular" status

### Impact on American Army

The 34th Division's success at Hill 609 had effects far beyond the tactical:

1. **Proved American Infantry Capability:** Demonstrated US forces could defeat German troops in difficult terrain
2. **Validated Training Methods:** Showed US training doctrine could produce effective combat soldiers
3. **Boosted Allied Morale:** First clear US victory boosted confidence for Sicily and Italy campaigns
4. **Informed Doctrine:** Lessons learned influenced US Army infantry tactics for remainder of war
5. **Created Veterans:** Division became core of experienced troops for Italian Campaign

### The Hill 609 Legacy

Hill 609 remains in US Army history as:
- **Symbol of Redemption:** Overcoming failure through determination
- **Mountain Warfare Model:** Template for future mountain assault operations
- **Combined Arms Example:** Textbook coordination of infantry, artillery, armor, and engineers
- **Leadership Test:** Proving ground for commanders at all levels
- **Soldier Motivation:** Demonstration that ordinary soldiers could accomplish extraordinary feats

The 34th Infantry Division's North Africa experience, culminating in Hill 609, prepared them for the long, brutal Italian Campaign that would follow (1943-1945), where they would continue to distinguish themselves as one of the finest American divisions of World War II.
