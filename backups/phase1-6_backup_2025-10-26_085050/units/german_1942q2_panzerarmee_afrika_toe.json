      "German-Italian cooperation issues persist: Language barriers, different tactical doctrine, German prioritization for fuel/ammunition creates Italian resentment"

    "desert_adaptations": "All units adapted for North African desert warfare. German units: Tropical uniforms, sand filters on all vehicles, desert tires, increased water capacity, sun compass navigation, mobile workshops, water discipline (12-15L/man/day). Italian units: Similar adaptations but limited resources, heavier reliance on captured British equipment (especially 90. leichte Division). Panzerarmee emphasis Q2 1942: Stockpiling supplies April-May for Gazala offensive, mobile workshops prepared for sustained operations, aggressive reconnaissance to find water sources/supply dumps/enemy positions, capture of British supply dumps essential (Tobruk capture 21 June yielded massive stocks)."
