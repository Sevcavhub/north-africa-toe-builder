Despite having only 17.5% of authorized trucks, the division fought effectively in defensive operations under von Sponeck's command. The division's equipment mix of German, captured Soviet, captured French, and captured British weapons reflects the desperate supply situation. Montgomery later praised von Sponeck's handling of the retreat from El Alamein."
