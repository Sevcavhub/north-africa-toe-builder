Gaps in specific staff officers, some support unit designations, and casualty figures. Standard Indian division TO&E structure used to estimate support units where specific 1943-Q2 evidence lacking. Division was at two-brigade strength (5th and 7th) as 11th Brigade not yet reformed after Tobruk capture June 1942. Division's Tunisia performance well-documented (mountain warfare expertise, von Arnim capture), providing high confidence in operational narrative despite some organizational detail gaps."
