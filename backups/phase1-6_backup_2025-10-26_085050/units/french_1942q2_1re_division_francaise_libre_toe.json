    "historical_context": "In 1942-Q2, the 1st Free French Brigade (not yet formally a division) was the primary Free French ground combat formation in North Africa. It defended Bir Hakeim fortress from May 26 to June 11, 1942, anchoring the southern end of the British Eighth Army's Gazala Line. The 15-day siege became legendary in Free French history. The unit was reorganized as the 1st Free French Division (1re DFL) in February 1943 by combining three brigades.",
    "designation_note": "During 1942-Q2, this force was officially designated as '1re Brigade Française Libre' (1st Free French Brigade) under British command. The designation '1re Division Française Libre' (1st Free French Division) was not formally adopted until February 1, 1943. However, the seed file uses the division designation for consistency across quarters, so this extraction follows that convention.",
    "bir_hakeim_significance": "The Battle of Bir Hakeim (May 26 - June 11, 1942) was the first major Free French engagement against German forces in North Africa. General Koenig's refusal to surrender despite three German ultimatums, and the successful breakout on June 10-11, became a symbol of French resistance. The defense inflicted significant delays on Rommel's Gazala offensive and earned widespread Allied admiration. De Gaulle declared: 'When, at Bir Hakeim, a ray of renascent glory came to caress the bloody forehead of her soldiers, the world recognized France.'",
    "casualties_bir_hakeim": "During the 15-day siege: 900 dead, wounded, missing, or captured (600 during the breakout night of June 10-11). Enemy losses: 50 tanks, 11 armored cars, 5 mounted guns, 7 aircraft destroyed. 279 Axis prisoners captured (125 German, 154 Italian).",
    "water_crisis": "By June 8, water reserves critically low. Rationing reduced to 2 liters per man per day (4 tin cups for 12 hours in desert heat). Medical services unable to re-bandage wounds due to water shortage. Final convoy breakthrough June 8 brought only 2 water trucks, extending supplies to June 11.",
    "british_support": "Brigade received air support from RAF Kittyhawks and British columns operating southwest of Bir Hakeim. British 30th Corps commander sent congratulations telegram June 4: 'Excellent job, hold out, congratulations, everything is going to be fine.' Final evacuation order came from British Eighth Army Command on June 9."
