Division engaged in breakthrough operations at Fondouk-Kairouan axis (April 20-30) and exploitation toward Tunis (May 1-7). Entered northern Tunis suburbs May 7, 1943 as Axis forces collapsed. Campaign concluded with mass Axis surrender May 13, 1943 (approximately 275,000 German and Italian prisoners). Division casualties for Q2: estimated 1,280 killed/wounded/missing (10.7% strength), primarily during April breakthrough fighting. Post-campaign: Division withdrew to Algeria for rest, refit, and re-equipment with US weapons before reassignment to French Expeditionary Corps for Italian campaign."

Q2 data derived from Q1 baseline with adjustments for final offensive operations, compared against parallel Algerian March Division Q2 data. Primary gaps are precise casualty figures, detailed equipment loss documentation, and subordinate commander identities. Historical context of final Tunisia offensive well-established. Division's role in Allied final offensive confirmed through multiple sources. Attrition patterns realistic for intensive April-May 1943 combat. Further research recommended: (1) French Service Historique de la Défense archives for Division de Marche de Constantine April-May 1943 operational reports and personnel records, (2) British First Army after-action reports on French XIX Corps and constituent divisions, (3) US Army G2 liaison reports with French forces, (4) Constantine regional archives for December 1942 formation details and mobilization records, (5) Regimental histories for 2nd, 4th, and 8th Régiments de Tirailleurs Algériens. Post-Tunisia fate well-documented: withdrawal to Algeria, refit, re-equipment with US weapons, integration into French Expeditionary Corps for Italian campaign 1943-1945."
