It arrived in North Africa in spring 1941, participated in the siege of Tobruk, and was heavily damaged during Operation Crusader (November-December 1941). The division was reformed in February-March 1942 and was operational during the 1942-Q2 timeframe, participating in the Battle of Gazala (May-June 1942) and the subsequent fall of Tobruk. The division was finally destroyed at the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. Motorization was a key characteristic, with all infantry transported in trucks and artillery fully motorized, enabling rapid deployment and sustained mobile operations in the desert. However, the division suffered from chronic fuel shortages and vehicle maintenance challenges typical of Italian forces in North Africa."
