Division composition confirmed: 157th LIGURIA Infantry Regiment, 158th LIGURIA Infantry Regiment, 45th CIRENE Artillery Regiment. Binary structure implemented March 1940 reduced regiments from 3 to 2, reducing combat power but increasing administrative efficiency. This was a standard foot-mobile division (NOT autotrasportabile like Brescia/Pavia), with limited motor transport (145 trucks vs. 300+ for motorized divisions). Artillery: 36 guns standard binary allocation (24× 75/27mm, 12× 100/17mm). Division destroyed during British Operation Compass and follow-on offensive (December 1940-February 1941).

Equipment allocations from TM E 30-420 standard binary division tables, adjusted for non-motorized status. Vehicle counts significantly lower than autotrasportabile divisions. Division fate well-documented (destroyed 1940-41) but commander name remains unidentified in available sources."
