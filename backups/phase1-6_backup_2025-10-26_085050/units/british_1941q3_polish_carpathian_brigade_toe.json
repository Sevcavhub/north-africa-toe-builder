The brigade arrived Tobruk in late March 1941 and immediately began preparing defenses.\n\n**Q3 1941 Operations**:\n\n**July 1941**: Defensive operations against Axis probing attacks. Polish sector (southern perimeter) subjected to artillery bombardment and infantry raids. Brigade conducted aggressive patrolling into no-man's land, capturing prisoners and disrupting Axis positions. Several company-strength raids against Axis outposts.\n\n**August 1941**: Continued defensive operations. Luftwaffe bombing intensified - Tobruk harbor and defensive positions targeted daily. Polish anti-aircraft guns engaged Stuka dive-bombers. Aggressive patrolling continued - Polish patrols known for aggressiveness and tactical skill. Several battalion-strength defensive actions repulsed Axis probing attacks.\n\n**September 1941**: Preparation for potential breakout during planned Operation Crusader (November). Training intensified. Defensive positions improved - new minefields laid, anti-tank obstacles reinforced, bunkers strengthened. Polish morale excellent despite months of siege. Limited casualties but constant attrition from bombing, shelling, disease (dysentery, jaundice).\n\n**Morale and Effectiveness**: Polish troops highly motivated - fighting for Poland's liberation, no homeland to return to. Discipline excellent. Training standards high - many veterans of 1939 Polish Campaign. British command highly regarded Polish Carpathian Brigade as one of finest formations in Tobruk. Aggressive patrolling earned respect of Axis forces.\n\n**Casualties Q3**: Approximately 85 killed, 180 wounded, 25 missing during July-September 1941. Disease casualties (dysentery, heat exhaustion) approximately 200 (non-fatal, most returned to duty). Total combat and non-combat casualties: 490 (10% of strength), replaced by reinforcements arriving via destroyer.\n\n**Strengths**: Veteran troops, excellent morale, aggressive tactics, high marksmanship standards, strong unit cohesion, experienced leadership (Kopański highly capable).\n\n**Issues**: Limited fresh water (rationing), monotonous diet, no fresh replacements for equipment losses, isolation from Polish forces in Palestine, constant Luftwaffe bombing causing psychological strain."

Throughout siege (April-December 1941), Polish troops held southern sector of Tobruk perimeter with distinction. Aggressive patrolling doctrine kept Axis forces off-balance. Brigade earned exceptional reputation among British command and fellow garrison troops (9th Australian Division, 70th British Division, Czech battalion). Kopański's leadership and Polish troops' motivation (fighting for homeland liberation) produced outstanding combat performance despite difficult siege conditions. Water rationing, monotonous diet, constant Luftwaffe bombing, and isolation tested morale, but Polish discipline held firm. During Operation Crusader (November 1941), brigade participated in breakout operations linking with relieving Eighth Army forces. Brigade later fought in Tunisia (1942-1943), Monte Cassino (1944), and Italy (1944-1945) as part of Polish II Corps. Q3 1941 saw brigade maintaining defensive positions, conducting aggressive patrols, and preparing for eventual relief. Casualties moderate (approximately 10% during Q3) but steady attrition from combat and disease. Quarter ends with brigade at high readiness, morale excellent, poised for Operation Crusader breakout operations (November 1941).",
