This positioning allowed the division to survive intact and be committed later during the siege of Tobruk (1941). Commander Pietro Zaglio confirmed from multiple sources including Wikipedia and US G-2 (transcribed as 'SCATAGLIA' - likely OCR/transcription error). Personnel totals calculated from TM 30-420 standard binary autotrasportabile division organization (~7,500 men). Vehicle counts based on autotrasportabile division tables. Artillery confirmed: 26th Artillery Regiment 'Rubicone' with 12x 100/17, 24x 75/27 (standard for binary division). Division composition from Nafziger 940ILAB matches US G-2 document exactly. Schema v3.1.0 includes required supply_logistics and weather_environment sections for scenario generation. High confidence (88%) due to multiple primary source confirmation and clear documentation of reserve status during Operation Compass period."
