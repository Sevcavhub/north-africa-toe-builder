The division did NOT exist as a functioning division in 1943-Q1. Survivors (~850 personnel) were evacuated to Tunisia and integrated into the 101st Motorized Division 'Trieste' as 'III Battalion Trento' (3 companies). This entry documents the remnant formation for historical completeness, as the seed file lists 1943-Q1 for Trento Division. Confidence is LOW (45%) due to: (1) Division did not exist as organized formation; (2) Limited documentation of survivor integration; (3) Equipment/personnel estimates based on standard battalion strength; (4) No primary sources for remnant battalion composition. This unit should be researched further using Italian military archives (AUSSME) or detailed Tunisia Campaign sources before considering it 'production ready'."
