Lieutenant-General O'Connor's 38,000-man force attacked the Italian 10th Army's 150,000 troops in fortified positions across Egypt and eastern Libya. In 10 weeks, the WDF advanced 800 kilometers, destroyed 10 Italian divisions, captured 130,000 prisoners, 400 tanks, and 1,290 guns, while suffering only 500 killed and 1,373 wounded. The campaign began with the dawn assault on Nibeiwa Camp (9 December), where 11th Indian Infantry Brigade and 7th RTR's 47 Matilda tanks destroyed the Italian Maletti Group. Success at Sidi Barrani (9-11 December) was followed by victories at Bardia (January 1941) and culminated in the Battle of Beda Fomm (February 1941), which destroyed the remnants of Italian 10th Army. The 7th RTR's Matilda II tanks proved invincible against Italian anti-tank weapons, though mechanical attrition reduced their strength from 48 to 22 operational tanks by late December. The 4th Indian Division transferred to Sudan starting 12 December for the East African Campaign, reducing WDF infantry strength but not affecting the momentum of operations. The campaign demonstrated superior British training, tactics, and equipment despite significant numerical inferiority. WDF was renamed XIII Corps on 1 January 1941. Quarter ends with British forces having achieved complete victory in Egypt and preparing for further advances into Libya."
