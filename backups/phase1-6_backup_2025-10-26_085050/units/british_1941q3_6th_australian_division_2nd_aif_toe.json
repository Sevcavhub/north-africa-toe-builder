The division was significantly under strength, with many units at 70-80% of establishment. Commander Iven Mackay was replaced by Major-General E.F. Herring on 14 August 1941. The 19th Brigade and elements of other brigades were on garrison duty in Syria following the successful Syria-Lebanon Campaign against Vichy French forces. The division would remain in the Middle East until early 1942 when recalled to Australia after Pearl Harbor.",

Participated in Syria-Lebanon Campaign (June-July 1941) defeating Vichy French forces. Total casualties through mid-1941: approximately 5,500 killed, wounded, and captured.",
