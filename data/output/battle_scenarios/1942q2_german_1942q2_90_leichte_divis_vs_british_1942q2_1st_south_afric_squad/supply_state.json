Primary supply route from Tobruk (35km) improved from Q1. Battle of Gazala (26 May - 14 June) disrupted supply lines as Axis forces broke through southern flank. Division successfully withdrew along coastal road to Mersa Matruh by month's end without significant supply collapse, though under constant pressure. Approximately 17,000 men (including 5,000 non-Europeans) maintained throughout quarter despite combat operations.",
