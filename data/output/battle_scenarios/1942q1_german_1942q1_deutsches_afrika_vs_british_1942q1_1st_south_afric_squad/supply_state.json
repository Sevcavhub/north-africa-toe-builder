British naval interdiction (Malta-based RAF/RN) destroys 30-40% of Axis convoys. Fuel reserves 5-6 days (lowest of war so far), ammunition 8-9 days, water 10-15L/man/day (critical desert constraint), food 10-12 days. Rommel Papers document: 'Only 18,000 tons reached Panzer Army in March 1942 out of 60,000 ton requirement.' Supply convoy arrived 5 Jan 1942 (55 tanks, 20 armored cars, AT guns) enabled Jan counter-offensive. Supply base: Tripoli port (sole Axis lifeline). Forward supply dumps at Mersa el Brega (Jan), Benghazi recaptured 29 Jan (critical port). Q1 1942: Rebuilding phase after Crusader losses.",

Division was 5,570 men under-strength as of 8 January 1942 (17,617 vs authorized 23,187). Supply situation stable during defensive preparations but constrained by limited port capacity at Tobruk and long haul from Egypt.",
