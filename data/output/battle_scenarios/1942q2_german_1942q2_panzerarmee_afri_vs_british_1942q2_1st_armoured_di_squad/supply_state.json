Supply lines from Tripoli (800km) and Benghazi (recaptured Jan 1942, now operational 350km forward). British Malta-based RAF/RN interdiction destroys 25-35% of Axis Mediterranean convoys. Q2 1942 build-up: Fuel reserves 6-8 days (improved from Q1 crisis), ammunition 8-12 days, water 10-15L/man/day. Rommel accumulated supplies April-May for Gazala offensive. CRITICAL STRATEGIC ISSUE: British Grant tanks arriving Egypt with 75mm gun superior to all Axis tanks except 43 Panzer IV F2 (19% of German tank strength). Rommel's gamble: Attack before British 8th Army fully equipped. Italian units heavily dependent on German logistics coordination. Supply crisis WILL occur if offensive extends beyond Tobruk into Egypt (historical: First Alamein supply collapse July 1942). Theater logistics: Tripoli main port (25-35% convoy losses), Benghazi forward port (critical for Gazala), coastal road vulnerable to British air/commando raids, no railway. German DAK prioritized for fuel/ammunition over Italian divisions.",
