Fuel deliveries irregular, ammunition stocks adequate for defensive operations but declining. Water from Bardia wells adequate. Food supplies moderate (15-20 days). No indication of imminent collapse but sustainability questionable for extended operations. Supply situation will deteriorate rapidly once British besiege Bardia.",
