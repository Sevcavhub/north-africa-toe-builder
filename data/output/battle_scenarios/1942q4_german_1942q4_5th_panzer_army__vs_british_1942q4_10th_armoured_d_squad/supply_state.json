Primary constraint: maritime supply line from Italy (200km Sicily-Tunisia crossing) under constant Allied air/naval interdiction. Axis convoy losses averaging 30-40% in December 1942. Fuel critical priority. Tunis port operating at reduced capacity. Competition with Panzerarmee Afrika supply needs creating shortages.
