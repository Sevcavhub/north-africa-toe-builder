  "terrain_type": "Northern and central Tunisia - highly varied terrain. Coastal plains (Tunis, Bizerte area) suitable for mechanized operations. Eastern Dorsal mountain range (Faïd Pass, Kasserine Pass, Sbiba Pass) creates natural defensive barrier - rocky mountains up to 1,000-1,500m elevation with limited pass roads. Central plateau region between mountains and coast - mixed agricultural land and rocky hills. Wadis (dry riverbeds) throughout - flash flood hazards during winter rains. More compartmentalized terrain than Libyan open desert - limits maneuver warfare, favors defensive operations.",

  "seasonal_impacts": "Q1 1943 rainy season severely impacts operations. Heavy rainfall (Jan-March) turns roads to mud, restricts off-road mobility to tracked vehicles only. Wheeled truck traffic limited to paved roads - creates supply bottlenecks. Mountain passes become chokepoints in wet weather. Wadis flood during storms - temporary water obstacles (6-24 hours). Cold nights (6-10°C) in mountains strain troops without adequate winter clothing (many units equipped for desert operations, not mountain winter warfare). Reduced dust improves visibility vs Libyan desert but mud degrades mobility equally. Allied air operations occasionally disrupted by weather (low clouds, rain) but Luftwaffe too weak to exploit - Allied air superiority maintained throughout quarter.",
  "environmental_challenges": [
    "Mud and rain restrict mobility - wheeled vehicles road-bound, tracked vehicles degraded cross-country speed",
    "Mountain passes create natural defensive positions but also restrict German maneuver warfare",
    "Wadi flooding during rains creates temporary obstacles (particularly after heavy storms)",
    "Cold mountain nights (6-10°C) require winter clothing - many German units lack adequate cold weather gear",
    "Compartmentalized terrain prevents mutual support - northern sector (vs British First Army) and central sector (vs US II Corps) operationally separated by mountains",
    "Allied air superiority forces all German movement to nighttime - reduces operational tempo, increases traffic congestion, limits reconnaissance",
    "Limited paved road network creates bottlenecks - particularly critical given supply dependence on Tunis/Bizerte ports",
    "Agricultural villages and olive groves restrict cross-country tank movement (vs open Libyan desert)",
    "Winter weather diseases - respiratory infections, trench foot in wet positions, dysentery from contaminated water"
