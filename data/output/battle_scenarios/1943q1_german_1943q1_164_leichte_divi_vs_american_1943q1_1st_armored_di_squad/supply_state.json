    "supply_status": "Critical shortage improving slightly with shorter supply lines from Tunis. Fuel and ammunition remain most critical. Division's supply situation benefiting from shorter logistics tail but still constrained by Allied air and naval interdiction. Tunis port under constant air attack. Supply convoys from Sicily heavily attacked. By March, Axis forces in Tunisia increasingly isolated with dwindling reserves.",
    "notes": "Fuel situation slightly improved from Q4 but still severely constrained. Artillery ammunition rationed to 15-20 rounds per gun per day. Small arms ammunition adequate. Food situation reasonable but declining. Supply route via Tunis constantly interdicted by Allied air and naval forces. Fuel shortages limit mobility and training. Many vehicles immobilized for lack of fuel or spare parts."
