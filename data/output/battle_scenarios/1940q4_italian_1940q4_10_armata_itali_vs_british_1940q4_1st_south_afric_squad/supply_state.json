British Operation Compass (9 Dec 1940) exposed Italian supply vulnerabilities. Forward divisions at Sidi Barrani deployed in isolated fortified camps (Nibeiwa, Tummar, Maktila) with inadequate supply stocks. Fuel reserves critically low (3-5 days for motorized units), ammunition stocks depleted after September advance to Sidi Barrani (8-12 days combat load). Water supply adequate from coastal wells but delivery to forward camps problematic. Commander Berti on sick leave when Operation Compass launched - command confusion exacerbated supply crisis. By end of Q4 1940, 10th Army facing complete collapse.",
