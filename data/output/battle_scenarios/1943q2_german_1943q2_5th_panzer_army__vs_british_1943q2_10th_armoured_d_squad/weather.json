  "terrain_type": "Cap Bon peninsula and northern Tunisia final defensive perimeter. Mountainous terrain with coastal plains. Djebel Abderrahman mountains (800-1,000m elevation) provide natural defensive barrier. Coastal plains suitable for mechanized operations (favors Allied armor superiority). Numerous wadis, olive groves, agricultural villages create compartmented terrain. Final perimeter centered on Tunis-Bizerte area compressed to Cap Bon peninsula (30km x 40km) by May 8. Restrictive terrain limits maneuver but also restricts Allied flanking movements - forces frontal assaults. Tunis urban area (population ~200,000) falls May 7 - street fighting avoided as German forces withdraw to peninsula. Cap Bon peninsula rocky hills and coastal lowlands - limited water sources (springs, wells adequate). Terrain favors defense but immobile defense without fuel/vehicles = death trap vs Allied mobility.",

  "seasonal_impacts": "Q2 1943 spring rainy season ending, early summer beginning. April rainfall moderate (3-5 days rain/month) - improves from Q1 mud but roads still occasionally wet. May rainfall minimal (1-2 days/month) - ground dries, dust returns. Temperature rising April (12-24째C) to May (15-28째C) to June (18-32째C projected). Heat stress increasing for troops in defensive positions without adequate water transport (wells only). Daylight hours increasing April (12.5 hours) to May (13.5 hours) to June (14+ hours) - extended daylight favors Allied air operations. Weather generally clear April-May - excellent flying conditions = continuous Allied air attacks. German nighttime movement still viable but Allied night fighters increasingly active. Terrain conditions improving for mechanized operations vs Q1 mud - favors Allied armor superiority. Environmental impact on final collapse: Clear weather enables Allied air supremacy to devastate German positions. Extended daylight restricts German movement to 8-10 hours/night vs 12-14 hours Q1. Rising temperatures increase water demand but German truck losses prevent adequate water distribution to forward positions (rely on local wells). Overall: Weather conditions favor Allied operations, compound German supply disadvantages.",
  "environmental_challenges": [
    "Total Allied air supremacy - clear spring weather enables continuous air attacks on German positions, supply columns, headquarters",
    "Extended daylight hours (13-14 hours May-June) restrict German movement to nighttime only - reduces operational tempo",
    "Rising temperatures (approaching 30째C June) increase water demand but German transport losses prevent distribution (troops rely on local wells)",
    "Compartmented terrain restricts maneuver - German forces trapped in static positions without fuel for repositioning",
    "Coastal perimeter vulnerability - Allied amphibious threat forces dispersed defense (never materialized but tied down troops)",
    "Urban combat in Tunis May 7 - avoided by German withdrawal but demonstrates defensive challenges",
    "Rocky terrain restricts digging - defensive positions exposed to Allied artillery fire (limited overhead cover)",
    "Olive groves and agricultural fields restrict fields of fire - favors Allied infantry infiltration",
    "No winter shelter needed (vs Q1) but heat shelter increasingly critical May-June for troops in exposed positions",
    "Disease: dysentery, typhus spreading in crowded defensive positions with inadequate sanitation (25,000+ wounded in improvised field hospitals)"
