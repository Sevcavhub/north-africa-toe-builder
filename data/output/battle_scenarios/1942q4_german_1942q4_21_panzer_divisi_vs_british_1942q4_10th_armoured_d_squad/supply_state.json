    "supply_status": "Critical shortage. Fuel and ammunition severely constrained due to Allied interdiction of Mediterranean supply lines. Less than half of supplies sent from Europe reached Africa in October 1942. Oil tankers Tripolino and Ostia sunk November 1, forcing reliance on air-delivered fuel from Crete. One-third of fuel stranded at Benghazi, unable to reach front. Primary constraint: 1,800km supply line from Tripoli, vulnerable to Royal Navy and RAF attacks. Division could not conduct sustained mobile operations due to fuel shortage - only 1/10th of fuel needed for offensive action available.",
    "notes": "Severe fuel crisis crippled mobility. Division maintained defensive posture at El Alamein due to inability to maneuver. By November 1942, retreat to Tunisia hampered by lack of transport fuel."
