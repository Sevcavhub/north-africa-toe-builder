## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Infantry division for occupation duties and limited offensive operations in North African theater

**Special Capabilities**:
- Autotrasportabile organization - partial motorization for road movement
- Mixed motor and animal transport for operational flexibility
- Adapted for North African desert conditions

**Known Issues**:
- Insufficient motorization - could not move entire division simultaneously
- Obsolete WWI-era artillery (75mm M1906, 100mm M1914)
- Limited anti-tank capability (only 8x 47mm AT guns)
- Binary (two-regiment) structure reduced infantry strength compared to three-regiment divisions
- 20mm AA guns inadequate against modern aircraft

**Desert Adaptations**: Mixed motor and animal transport system. Extensive mule train (1,240 mules) enabled operations in rough terrain when vehicles unavailable. Water conservation protocols.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 6/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Mixed transport: Can operate with reduced mobility when vehicles unavailable
- Desert-adapted: No penalty for desert terrain
- Weak AT defense: -1 modifier vs armor
- Metropolitan division: Higher morale than colonial units
- Semi-motorized: Can move at half speed without vehicles using animal transport

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Italian defensive operations in Tripolitania (Q4 1940)
- Preparation for Invasion of Egypt (training scenarios)
- Operation Compass defensive scenarios (British offensive December 1940)
- Border patrol and security operations

**Known Gaps**:
- Chief of Staff name not documented
- Some subordinate unit commanders unknown (Engineer Battalion, Transport Section, Medical Company)
- Exact vehicle variant distribution estimated from standard Italian division TO&E
- Precise operational equipment counts estimated at 90-95% of authorized strength
- WITW game IDs not available for Italian equipment
- Exact headquarters location within Tripolitania not specified in sources

## Conclusion
