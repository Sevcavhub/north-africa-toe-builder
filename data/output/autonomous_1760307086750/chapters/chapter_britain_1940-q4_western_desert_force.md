## Organizational Structure

### 1. 7th Armoured Division

- **Commander**:  Major-General Michael O'Moore Creagh
- **Strength**: 19500 personnel
- **Notes**: Desert Rats - Primary mobile striking force for Operation Compass. 195 tanks (110 cruisers, 85 light tanks).

### 2. 4th Indian Infantry Division

- **Commander**:  Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse
- **Strength**: 17800 personnel
- **Notes**: Main infantry assault force for Operation Compass (9-11 Dec). Transferred to Sudan starting 12 December 1940 for East African Campaign. 16th Brigade detached 14 December.

### 3. 7th Royal Tank Regiment

- **Commander**:  Lieutenant-Colonel R. M. Jerram
- **Strength**: 310 personnel
- **Notes**: Corps troops - Independent tank battalion supporting 4th Indian Division. 47 Matildas participated in Nibeiwa attack (9 Dec). Reduced to 22 operational by 27 December due to combat losses and mechanical breakdowns. Matildas impervious to Italian anti-tank weapons.

### 4. Selby Force

- **Commander**:  Brigadier A. R. Selby
- **Strength**: 1800 personnel
- **Notes**: Advanced from Mersa Matruh under Selby's command. Attacked Italian forces along coast road east of Sidi Barrani during Operation Compass. Trapped remnants of two Libyan divisions and 4th Blackshirt Division with 16th Infantry Brigade.

### 5. No. 1 Company, 2nd New Zealand Divisional Signals (attached)

- **Commander**:  Major (name unknown)
- **Strength**: 185 personnel
- **Notes**: Corps Signals for Western Desert Force (temporary attachment due to lack of Royal Signals personnel with necessary technical qualifications). Served through Operation Compass until fall of Benghazi (Feb 1941).

### 6. Corps Headquarters

- **Commander**:  Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor
- **Strength**: 285 personnel
- **Notes**: Mobile headquarters during Operation Compass. Minimal staff reflecting O'Connor's lean command style. WDF renamed XIII Corps on 1 January 1941.

## Supply Status

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 10 | Low |
| Ammunition | 18 | Adequate |
| Food | 20 | Adequate |
| Water | 285000 L/day | Adequate |

**Assessment**: Operational tempo during Operation Compass - supply lines stretched during rapid advance. Initial 5-day raid planning extended to 2-month campaign. Advanced supply dumps established before offensive. Water critical in desert operations.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Execution of Operation Compass - British counter-offensive to expel Italian 10th Army from Egypt and advance into Libya. First major British offensive of WWII.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Combined arms mobile warfare coordination (armor, infantry, artillery)
- Deep reconnaissance and intelligence gathering (11th Hussars screening operations)
- Rapid exploitation following breakthrough
- Night movement and navigation in trackless desert terrain
- Infantry-tank cooperation tactics (Matildas supporting Indian infantry)
- Surprise attack planning and execution
- Minimal logistics operational capability (extended 5-day raid into 2-month campaign)

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Matilda infantry tanks used in breakthrough role with devastating effect against Italian fortified camps
- Combined arms 'jock columns' (7th Armoured Division mobile battlegroups)
- Night approach marches followed by dawn assaults (Nibeiwa attack model)
- Deep armoured reconnaissance preceding main force movements
- Sequential brigade attacks maintaining operational momentum
- Extensive use of deception and surprise (Italian commanders unaware of offensive until attacked)
- Desert navigation using sun compass and dead reckoning techniques

**Known Issues**:
- Tank mechanical reliability critical issue - 35 of 243 tanks non-operational at start
- Matilda losses mounted during operation: 48 tanks reduced to 22 operational by 27 December
- Supply lines stretched dangerously during rapid exploitation phase (planned 5-day raid became 2-month campaign)
- Limited tank recovery and repair capabilities during mobile operations
- Light tanks (Mk VI) inadequate for combat - reconnaissance only
- Cruiser tank gun traverse slow compared to Italian M11/39
- Dust problems affecting engines, vision devices, and weapons
- Water supply critical constraint in desert operations (285,000 liters/day required)
- 4th Indian Division transferred to Sudan mid-quarter, reducing WDF infantry strength
- Minimal air support compared to Italian Regia Aeronautica numerical strength

**Desert Adaptations**: Enhanced water capacity (285,000 liters/day for 38,000 men), improved air filters (partially implemented), desert navigation equipment (sun compass standard), light desert uniforms, modified camouflage nets for desert use, specialized desert rations, extensive mechanical spares for tank operations, mobile workshops, forward supply dumps pre-positioned before Operation Compass.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 9/10
**Experience Level**: Veteran

**Special Rules**:
- Desert Rats - 7th Armoured Division veteran desert warfare specialists (+2 to desert terrain operations)
- Operation Compass Victory - First major British offensive success of WWII (+2 morale)
- Matilda Invincibility - Matilda II tanks impervious to Italian anti-tank guns (ignore Italian AT guns up to 47mm)
- Superior Reconnaissance - 11th Hussars armoured cars provide exceptional intelligence (+3 to reconnaissance)
- Combined Arms Mastery - Proven infantry-tank cooperation at Nibeiwa (+2 when infantry and tanks coordinate)
- Rapid Exploitation - Can pursue retreating enemy with minimal delay
- Night Operations - Skilled at night approach marches and dawn attacks
- O'Connor's Leadership - Exceptional command providing operational flexibility and initiative
- Outnumbered but Superior - Higher quality troops and equipment vs Italian numerical advantage
- Supply Constraints - Extended operations beyond planned duration may face supply penalties

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Operation Compass - Battle of Sidi Barrani (9-11 December 1940) - PRIMARY SCENARIO
- Attack on Nibeiwa Camp (9 December 1940, dawn assault)
- Capture of Tummar West and Tummar East (9-10 December 1940)
- Battle of Bardia (3-5 January 1941)
- Advance on Tobruk (January 1941)
- Battle of Beda Fomm (5-7 February 1941)
- Selby Force coastal operations (December 1940)
- 11th Hussars deep reconnaissance missions
- Mobile armoured warfare and pursuit operations
- Combined infantry-tank assault scenarios (Matildas + Indian infantry)
