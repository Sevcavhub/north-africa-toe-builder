## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Static defense and limited offensive operations in North African desert terrain

**Special Capabilities**:
- Autotrasportabile organization - could be transported by truck when vehicles available
- Adapted for desert operations with animal transport backup
- Extensive use of mule transport for rough terrain

**Known Issues**:
- Insufficient motorization - only enough trucks to move portion of division at once
- Obsolete artillery (WWI-era Austrian guns refurbished in 1933)
- Limited anti-tank capability (only 8x 47mm AT guns)
- Binary (two-regiment) structure left division undermanned compared to three-regiment divisions
- Personnel in support units lacked infantry training

**Desert Adaptations**: Mixed motor and animal transport system allowed operation when grounded from vehicles. Extensive mule train enabled mountain/rough terrain operations.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 6/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Mixed transport: Can operate with reduced mobility when vehicles unavailable
- Desert-adapted: No penalty for desert terrain
- Weak AT defense: -1 modifier vs armor
- Metropolitan division: Higher morale than colonial units

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Operation Compass (British offensive, December 1940)
- Battle of Bardia (January 1941)
- Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940)
- Border skirmishes at Fort Capuzzo (June-July 1940)
