## Critical Supply Situation (Schema v3.0 Section 6)

The division's supply state was **catastrophic** at El Alamein:

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Fuel Reserves** | 1.5 days | CRITICAL - immobilized during final battle |
| **Ammunition** | 3 days | Sufficient for short combat |
| **Water** | 3.5 L/person/day | Rationed (below 4L desert minimum) |
| **Operational Radius** | 85 km | Severely limited by fuel |
| **Supply Line** | 1,800 km from Tripoli | Repeatedly interdicted |

**Fuel exhaustion was the primary cause of the division's destruction.** Tanks were forced to fight in static positions during the final encirclement.

---

## Environmental Conditions (Schema v3.0 Section 7)

| Factor | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Season** | 1942-Q4 (Oct-Dec) | Late autumn, cooler |
| **Temperature** | 12-28°C | Moderate, not extreme heat |
| **Terrain** | Coastal plain, rocky desert | Good tank country |
| **Sandstorms** | 1 day/month | Minimal disruption |
| **Daylight** | 11.5 hours | Favors defender |

The El Alamein position (65km west of Alexandria) was tactically constrained between the Mediterranean coast and the impassable Qattara Depression, limiting maneuver options.
