| Ammunition | 10 | Low |
| Food | 18 | Adequate |
| Water | 7 L/day | Unknown |

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Corps-level command for mobile desert warfare - defense of Egypt against Italian invasion from Libya

**Special Capabilities**:
- Combined arms integration (armour, infantry, artillery)
- Extended desert operations with long supply lines
- Mobile defense using armoured reconnaissance screen
- Coordination of British and Commonwealth forces

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Use of corps-level tank reserve (7th RTR Matildas) for breakthrough operations
- Integrated signals network using New Zealand technical expertise
- Forward headquarters at Baggush Box enabling rapid response
- Combined British-Indian command structure

**Known Issues**:
- Severe tank shortage across formation (234 vs 340+ authorized)
- Extended supply lines from Alexandria (150 miles)
- Limited medium artillery compared to Italian 10th Army
- New formation still integrating command procedures
- Water supply constraints in desert operations

## Critical Equipment Shortages

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 7/10
**Experience Level**: Regular (becoming Veteran by year end)

**Special Rules**:
- Desert Navigation: No penalty for open terrain movement
- Extended Supply Lines: -1 penalty to supply rolls beyond 150 miles from Alexandria
- Matilda Breakthrough: 7th RTR provides infantry tank support capability
