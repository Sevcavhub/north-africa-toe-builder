**SPECIAL NOTE**: This extraction commemorates one of the most heroic defensive actions of WWII. The Bir Hakeim defense (10-11 June 1942) demonstrated Free French determination and delayed Rommel's offensive. Général Kœnig's leadership during the 15-day siege earned him promotion to division commander and cemented Free France's reputation as a fighting force.
