## Tactical Doctrine

### Primary Role
Corps-level command and control for ground operations in Tunisia Campaign

### Special Capabilities
- Combined arms coordination (armor, infantry, artillery)
- Multi-division maneuver warfare
- Desert operations experience (albeit initially poor)
- Integration with Allied forces (British First Army, French forces)

### Tactical Innovations (Post-Patton)
- Improved armor-infantry coordination
- Enhanced reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
- Better anti-tank tactics against German panzers
- Consolidated defensive positions vs. dispersed

### Known Issues
1. **Inadequate Anti-Tank Weapons**
   - 37mm M3 gun ineffective against German armor
   - Reliance on 57mm (6-pounder) and field artillery

2. **Initial Leadership Problems**
   - Fredendall's poor tactical decisions at Kasserine
   - Inadequate coordination between units
   - Dispersed defensive positions

3. **Green Troops vs. Veterans**
   - US troops inexperienced vs. veteran German Afrika Korps
   - Learning curve resulted in heavy initial losses

4. **Equipment Limitations**
   - M3 Lee/Grant tanks inferior to German Panzer IV
   - Early M4 Shermans adequate but not superior

## Wargaming Data

### Scenario Suitability
1. Battle of Kasserine Pass (Feb 19-25, 1943) - Defeat scenario
2. Battle of El Guettar (March 23-April 7, 1943) - Defensive victory
3. Final Tunisia Campaign offensive (April-May 1943) - Offensive victory
4. Learning curve scenarios - Green vs veteran forces

### Game Statistics
- **Morale Rating:** 7/10
- **Experience Level:** Regular (varies by phase)
- **Command Rating:** 6/10 (Fredendall) â†’ 8/10 (Patton)

### Special Rules
1. **Patton Leadership Bonus** (post March 6): +1 to initiative
2. **Green Troops Penalty** (early Q1): -1 to first combat engagement
3. **Superior Logistics:** +2 to supply availability
4. **Allied Air Superiority:** +1 to artillery spotting
5. **Kasserine Lessons Learned** (post Feb 25): +1 to defensive coordination

### Historical Engagements
- **Feb 19-25, 1943:** Kasserine Pass (Defeat - Learning experience)
- **Mar 23-Apr 7, 1943:** El Guettar (Defensive Victory)
- **May 7, 1943:** Capture of Bizerta (Victory)
- **Apr-May 1943:** Final Tunisia offensive (Victory - set stage for Sicily)
