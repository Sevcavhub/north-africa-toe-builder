## Combat History

### Formation
- **Created**: November 8, 1942, from mobile group of Meknès, Morocco
- **Commander**: Général Maurice Mathenet (adjutant officer of Military Division of Meknès)
- **Initial action**: Port-Lyautey - Initially opposed American landings during Operation Torch

### Key Engagements (1943-Q1)

1. **Eastern Dorsal Mountains Defense** (January-March 1943)
   - Defensive positions in central Tunisia
   - 35 miles of front line held by French XIX Corps

2. **Battle of Faïd Pass** (January 30, 1943)
   - French forces defeated despite effective 75mm artillery fire
   - Demonstrated inadequacy of anti-tank weapons vs German armor
   - Canon de 75 mle 1897 performed well in indirect fire role

3. **Kasserine Pass Operations** (February 1943)
   - Part of larger French XIX Corps defensive effort
   - Mixed results against German offensive

4. **Battle of Zaghouan** (May 12, 1943) - Post Q1, but significant
   - Obtained surrender of German Colonel Pfeiffer (21st Panzer Division Kampfgruppe commander)
   - Obtained surrender of Italian Colonel Agnelo
   - Demonstrated division's combat effectiveness after re-equipment

### Command Relationships
- **Parent Formation**: French XIX Corps under Lieutenant General Marie-Louis Koëltz
- **Nominal Command**: British 1st Army
- **Operational Orders**: Général Juin (senior French commander, North Africa)
- **Coordination Issues**: Initial difficulties with Allied coordination due to recent armistice between Vichy French and Allies

### Post-Tunisia
After the Tunisia campaign ended May 13, 1943, the division was reorganized. Elements contributed to the formation of the **2e Division d'Infanterie Marocaine** (formed May 1, 1943) for the Italian campaign.

## Tactical Doctrine

### Role
Defensive infantry division holding sectors of the Eastern Dorsal Mountains in central Tunisia.

### Special Capabilities
- North African troops well-adapted to desert conditions
- Experienced in colonial warfare tactics
- Strong esprit de corps among Moroccan Tirailleurs units
- Excellent night fighters (Moroccan Tirailleurs specialty)

### Known Issues
1. **Inadequate anti-tank capability** - 47mm and 25mm guns insufficient vs Panzer IV and Tiger I
2. **Limited mechanization** - Compared to German and British forces
3. **Obsolete pre-war equipment** - Critical spare parts shortages
4. **Artillery limitations** - Effective but limited range and mobility compared to modern systems
5. **Initial coordination problems** - With Allied forces due to recent Vichy-Allied armistice

### Desert Adaptations
Troops well-acclimated to North African terrain and climate. French colonial forces had extensive desert warfare experience from pre-war operations in Morocco and Algeria.

3. **Exact operational counts**: Vehicle operational rates estimated from organizational tables and attrition
4. **Detailed equipment allocations**: Some variants estimated from standard French colonial division TO&E

### Methodology
Combined historical research from verified non-Wikipedia sources with existing project French 1943-Q1 data. Equipment counts based on standard French colonial division TO&E adjusted for documented shortages and re-equipment timeline. Personnel composition ratios (79% Maghrebi) from historical records of North African colonial units.
