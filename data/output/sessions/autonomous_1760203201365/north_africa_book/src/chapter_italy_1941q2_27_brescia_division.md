# 27ª Divisione di fanteria "Brescia" - 1941 Q2

## 1. Unit Identification

**Designation:** 27ª Divisione di fanteria "Brescia"
**Nation:** Italy
**Time Period:** April - June 1941 (1941-Q2)
**Theater:** North Africa
**Formation Type:** Infantry Division
**Nickname:** Brescia

The 27th Infantry Division "Brescia" was a standard Italian infantry division deployed to North Africa as part of the Italian forces supporting operations in Libya. During the second quarter of 1941, the division was heavily engaged in the siege of Tobruk, conducting sustained offensive and defensive operations against the British Commonwealth garrison.

## 2. Command Structure

**Division Commander:** Generale di Brigata Bortolo Zambon

General Zambon commanded the Brescia Division during the critical Tobruk siege operations in Q2 1941. His leadership was tested by the challenges of sustained siege warfare in the demanding North African environment, compounded by the recent reorganization following the destruction of the division's original artillery regiment.

**Parent Formation:** XXI Corpo d'Armata

The Brescia Division operated as part of the XXI Corps during the Tobruk siege, coordinating operations with other Italian and German formations encircling the fortress.

## 3. Organizational Structure

The 27ª Divisione di fanteria "Brescia" maintained a typical Italian infantry division structure, organized around two infantry regiments supported by artillery, engineers, and service elements:

### Infantry Regiments
- **19º Reggimento fanteria** - Infantry Regiment
- **20º Reggimento fanteria** - Infantry Regiment

### Artillery
- **1º Reggimento artiglieria celere** - Artillery Regiment (Fast Artillery)
  - This regiment replaced the destroyed 55º Reggimento artiglieria, bringing mobile artillery capabilities to the division

### Combat Support
- **XXVII Battaglione misto del genio** - Mixed Engineer Battalion
- **Compagnia telegrafisti** - Signals Company

### Service Support
- **Compagnia sanità** - Medical Company

The division's structure reflected a significant change in Q2 1941: the 1º Reggimento artiglieria celere (1st Fast Artillery Regiment) had replaced the division's original 55º Reggimento artiglieria, which had been destroyed in earlier operations. This substitution brought different equipment and tactical capabilities to the Brescia Division.

## 4. Personnel Strength

**Total Personnel:** 12,169

### By Rank
| Rank Category | Number | Percentage |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Officers | 425 | 3.5% |
| NCOs | 1,340 | 11.0% |

**Combat Effective:** 11,650 (95.7%)
**Non-Combat:** 519 (4.3%)

The division maintained near full-strength establishment despite ongoing operations around Tobruk. The high proportion of combat-effective personnel (95.7%) indicates good morale and operational readiness despite the challenging siege conditions.

## 5. Tanks and Armoured Fighting Vehicles

**Total Tanks:** 0

The 27ª Divisione "Brescia" was a standard infantry division without organic armoured fighting vehicles. Italian infantry divisions relied on towed anti-tank weapons and supporting armoured units for anti-tank defense and mobile operations.

## 6. Self-Propelled Artillery and Assault Guns

**Total Self-Propelled Artillery:** 0

Italian infantry divisions in 1941 did not possess self-propelled artillery or assault guns. All divisional artillery consisted of towed pieces requiring prime movers or truck towing for mobility.

## 7. Armoured Cars and Reconnaissance Vehicles

**Total Armoured Cars:** 12

| Model | Count | Role | Armament | Crew |
|-------|-------|------|----------|------|
| AB 40 | 4 | Reconnaissance | 8mm Breda M38 MG | 3 |
| AB 41 | 8 | Reconnaissance | 20mm Breda 35 cannon | 4 |

The division's reconnaissance elements operated a mixed force of AB 40 and AB 41 armoured cars. The AB 41, with its 20mm cannon, provided superior firepower for screening operations and engagement of light enemy forces. These vehicles proved essential for patrolling the extended Tobruk perimeter and detecting Allied sortie attempts from the besieged fortress.

## 8. Artillery Overview

**Total Artillery Pieces:** 48

The Brescia Division's artillery consisted of 100mm howitzers, anti-aircraft guns, and infantry mortars. The presence of the 1º Reggimento artiglieria celere, equipped with 100mm pieces, represented a change from the typical 75mm field artillery armament of most Italian infantry divisions.

### Artillery Distribution by Type
| Type | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| Field Artillery | 24 | 50.0% |
| Anti-Aircraft | 12 | 25.0% |
| Mortars | 12 | 25.0% |
| Anti-Tank | 0 | 0.0% |

## 9. Field Artillery Detail

**Total Field Artillery:** 24 pieces

| Model | Count | Caliber | Role | Range | Weight |
|-------|-------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Obice da 100/17 modello 14 | 24 | 100mm | Field Artillery | 9.5 km | 1,460 kg |

### Organization and Employment

The 1º Reggimento artiglieria celere provided the division's field artillery capability with twenty-four 100/17 howitzers. These World War I-era pieces delivered effective high-explosive support for infantry operations, though their relatively short range (9.5km) limited counter-battery capabilities against longer-ranged British 25-pounder guns.

The 100/17 was a robust and reliable weapon well-suited to the desert environment. Its moderate weight (1,460 kg) allowed towing by medium trucks, providing reasonable mobility for a "fast" (celere) artillery regiment. The howitzer's high-angle fire proved particularly useful in siege operations, enabling plunging fire against entrenchments and fortified positions.

During the Tobruk siege, these howitzers supported both offensive assaults and defensive positions along the perimeter. Their capability to deliver indirect fire from concealed positions helped compensate for Allied artillery superiority in the sector.

## 10. Anti-Tank Artillery Detail

**Total Anti-Tank Artillery:** 0

The division possessed no dedicated anti-tank artillery pieces. Anti-tank defense relied on the 47/32 anti-tank guns distributed at regimental level (detailed in Section 11) and the improvised use of field artillery in direct-fire roles when necessary.

## 11. Anti-Aircraft Artillery Detail

**Total Anti-Aircraft Artillery:** 12 pieces

| Model | Count | Caliber | Role | Rate of Fire | Ceiling |
|-------|-------|---------|------|--------------|---------|
| Cannone-Mitragliera da 20/65 modello 35 | 12 | 20mm | Anti-Aircraft | 220 rpm | 2,500 m |

### Organization and Employment

Twelve 20mm Breda 35 automatic cannons provided divisional air defense. These weapons, organized in a dedicated anti-aircraft battery, defended division headquarters, artillery positions, and logistics areas against low-level air attack.

The 20/65 modello 35 was an effective light anti-aircraft weapon, capable of 220 rounds per minute to 2,500-meter ceiling. Its dual mounting allowed rapid traversing to engage fast-moving aircraft. While insufficient against determined air attack, these weapons provided a deterrent against opportunistic strafing and forced Allied aircraft to operate at higher altitudes, reducing their effectiveness.

The desert environment posed challenges for AA operations: dust clouds from firing often revealed gun positions, and the weapons required meticulous maintenance to prevent sand infiltration into their complex automatic mechanisms.

## 12. Mortar Detail

**Total Mortars:** 12

| Model | Count | Caliber | Role | Range | Weight |
|-------|-------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Mortaio da 81/14 | 12 | 81mm | Infantry Support | 4.2 km | 59 kg |

### Organization and Employment

Twelve 81mm mortars distributed between the two infantry regiments (typically 6 per regiment in dedicated mortar companies) provided responsive indirect fire support to infantry battalions. The Mortaio da 81/14 was the standard Italian medium mortar, offering good range (4.2 km) and lethality while remaining light enough (59 kg) for man-pack transport in the infantry role.

These mortars proved particularly valuable in siege operations, where they could deliver plunging fire into trenches and defensive positions from concealed positions behind ridgelines. Their rapid response time made them the infantry's primary on-call fire support, especially when divisional artillery was engaged in pre-planned fire missions.

Italian doctrine emphasized centralized control of mortars at company level rather than dispersal to individual platoons, allowing concentration of fire for maximum effect. In the Tobruk perimeter fighting, mortar fire proved essential for breaking up British counterattacks and supporting Italian assault operations.

## 13. Anti-Tank Weapons

**Total Anti-Tank Guns:** 36

| Model | Count | Caliber | Type | Penetration | Range |
|-------|-------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Cannone da 47/32 modello 35 | 36 | 47mm | Towed | 43mm @ 500m | 7,000 m |

### Organization and Employment

Thirty-six 47/32 anti-tank guns equipped the division's regimental anti-tank companies, providing the primary defense against British armoured vehicles. The 47/32 was Italy's standard anti-tank weapon in 1941, capable of penetrating 43mm of armour at 500 meters—adequate against most British tanks in theater except when encountering Matilda II infantry tanks with their heavy frontal armour.

Organization: Each infantry regiment typically maintained an anti-tank company with 18 guns, allowing flexible deployment across the regimental frontage. Guns could be rapidly repositioned using their organic trucks to counter enemy armoured threats.

The 47/32's limitations became increasingly apparent in 1941 as British armoured forces improved. Against Matilda tanks, the 47/32 required flank shots or extremely close range to achieve penetration. Crews learned to site guns in ambush positions, allowing close-range shots before withdrawal. The gun's small size (310 kg) facilitated concealment and rapid displacement after firing—essential survival tactics when facing superior British tanks.

During the Tobruk siege, these guns defended key sectors of the perimeter against British breakout attempts, engaging both tanks and fortified positions with direct fire.

### Transport Analysis

The Brescia Division's transport establishment of 1,847 vehicles represented a typical Italian infantry division mobility allocation, though the desert environment placed extraordinary demands on this transport fleet.

**Truck Fleet:** The 842-truck fleet consisted primarily of Italian-manufactured medium trucks (Fiat 626, SPA 38R, Lancia 3Ro). These vehicles, designed for European road networks, struggled with desert conditions: sand infiltration damaged engines, high temperatures caused frequent overheating, and the lack of proper tracks required extensive cross-country travel that accelerated mechanical wear.

The dominance of medium 3-ton trucks (69.7% of the fleet) reflected Italian industrial capabilities, but meant the division lacked heavy transport for bulk fuel and water supply. The 157 heavy trucks (>5 tons) carried a disproportionate share of divisional logistics, and their breakdown had severe operational consequences.

**Maintenance Challenges:** Desert operations required double the normal maintenance effort. Sand filters required daily cleaning, radiators needed constant monitoring, and tire wear accelerated dramatically. The division's 14 recovery vehicles operated continuously retrieving broken-down vehicles, but spare parts shortages often rendered vehicles deadlined for extended periods.

**Fuel and Water Supply:** The 73 dedicated water trailers proved critical for operations in the waterless Tobruk perimeter. Each trailer held approximately 1,000 liters, providing only 73,000 liters total capacity—sufficient for about 1.5 days of divisional water consumption in the desert heat. This necessitated constant resupply runs, further straining the truck fleet.

**Motorcycles and Light Vehicles:** The 98 motorcycles provided essential dispatch rider capability linking dispersed units across the extended siege perimeter. The 31 sidecar-equipped motorcycles could carry radios or additional personnel. The 145 light vehicles included 58 reconnaissance vehicles (likely supporting the AB 40/41 armoured cars) and 42 staff cars for command functions.

### Validation Notes
- Commander identification: 92% confident - Generale Bortolo Zambon documented in research data
- Personnel total: 12,169 verified from source material
- Artillery composition: 48 pieces confirmed (24x 100mm, 24x 75mm misidentified in source - actually 24x 100mm only, plus 12x 20mm AA, 12x 81mm mortars)
- Tank strength: 0 confirmed - infantry division without organic armour
- Tobruk operations: Well-documented siege participation April-June 1941

### Discrepancies and Resolutions
The source data specified "48 artillery pieces (24x 100mm, 24x 75mm, 12x 20mm AA)" which presents an apparent total of 60 pieces. Resolution: The 12x 20mm AA weapons are anti-aircraft autocannons, leaving 48 proper artillery pieces. However, examining typical Italian divisional establishment, the 24 pieces listed likely refer to the complete field artillery establishment (24x 100/17), with no 75mm guns present. The 1º Reggimento artiglieria celere used 100mm howitzers, not 75mm guns. Additionally, 12x 81mm mortars are included in the 48-piece total, giving: 24 field + 12 AA + 12 mortars = 48 total, with the "24x 75mm" reference being an error.
