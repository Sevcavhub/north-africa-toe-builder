| Water | 7 L/day | Critical |

**Assessment**: Supply dependent on Axis convoy success. Bologna Division reduced to static defensive role at Tobruk siege.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Static infantry division engaged in siege operations around Tobruk. Semi-motorized classification indicates partial motorization for supply and artillery mobility.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Experienced in desert warfare after 15 months in North Africa
- Adapted to siege operations

**Known Issues**:
- Suffered heavy casualties in British counter-offensive 1940-1941
- Equipment worn from desert conditions and combat
- Morale declining due to prolonged siege operations
- Limited anti-tank capability against British armor
- Dependent on German support for offensive operations

**Desert Adaptations**: Troops experienced with desert conditions. Vehicles modified with sand filters. Water discipline established.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data
