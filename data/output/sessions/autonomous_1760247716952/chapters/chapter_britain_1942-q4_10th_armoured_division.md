**Assessment**: Well-supplied for El Alamein offensive, extensive logistical buildup during September-October 1942

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Mobile armoured exploitation and breakthrough operations in desert warfare

**Special Capabilities**:
- Combined arms operations with integrated infantry support
- Equipped with superior American tanks (Sherman, Grant)
- Experienced desert warfare formation
- Strong artillery support with proven 25-pdr guns

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Improved coordination between armoured and infantry brigades
- Use of American medium tanks with 75mm guns providing better HE and AP capability
- Concentrated anti-tank defense with 6-pdr guns

**Known Issues**:
- Brigade structure changes caused coordination challenges
- Loss of 9th Armoured Brigade to NZ Division temporarily reduced striking power
- 133rd Infantry Brigade only attached for limited period
- Some residual mechanical reliability issues with British-built tanks

**Desert Adaptations**: Fully adapted to desert operations by Q4 1942, extensive experience from Alam Halfa and El Alamein battles

## Critical Equipment Shortages

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 8/10
