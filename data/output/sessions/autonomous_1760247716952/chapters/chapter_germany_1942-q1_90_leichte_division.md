## Supply Status

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 9 | Low |
| Ammunition | 14 | Low |
| Food | 15 | Adequate |
| Water | 54000 L/day | Adequate |

**Assessment**: Supply situation slightly improved from Q4 1941; still weak motorization with desert supply challenges

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Light division for mobile operations and static defense around Tobruk; still limited mobility compared to Panzer divisions

**Special Capabilities**:
- Desert operations experience
- High infantry firepower with captured weapons
- Former French Foreign Legion personnel in Inf.Rgt. 361
- Flexible organization for desert warfare
- Experienced in siege operations

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Integration of captured British Empire weapons and vehicles
- Adaptation to desert supply constraints
- Mixed-unit composition for rapid deployment
- Effective use of limited resources in desert environment

**Known Issues**:
- Weak motorization compared to Panzer divisions
- Limited organic artillery support
- No tank component (true light infantry division)
- Supply line challenges in desert environment
- Ongoing organizational transitions (renamed April 1, 1942)
- Commander transition period after death of Sümmermann

**Desert Adaptations**: Division now battle-hardened from Operation Crusader and Tobruk operations; units further adapted to extreme heat, water scarcity, and desert terrain. Continued reliance on captured British vehicles due to supply difficulties. Improved coordination with Deutsches Afrikakorps.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 7/10
**Experience Level**: Veteran

**Special Rules**:
- Desert warfare penalties for water/fuel
- Reduced mobility due to weak motorization
- Former Foreign Legion troops (Inf.Rgt. 361) - unique morale characteristics
- Can use captured British weapons and vehicles
- No tank support - relies on anti-tank guns
- Battle-hardened from Operation Crusader
- Experienced in desert conditions

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Operation Crusader aftermath (January-March 1942)
- Gazala Line preparations (early 1942)
- Tobruk operations (early 1942)
- Desert reconnaissance missions
- Static defense scenarios
- North African campaign 1942
