## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Infantry Division - offensive and defensive operations in desert terrain

**Special Capabilities**:
- Desert warfare training in Palestine and Egypt
- High morale and esprit de corps from Australian volunteer force (2nd AIF)
- Experienced WWI veteran leadership at brigade and division levels
- Strong artillery support with 72x 25-pounders

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Development of water discipline procedures for desert operations
- Integration of Universal Carriers for infantry mobility
- Use of captured Italian equipment to supplement shortages

**Known Issues**:
- Limited anti-tank capability with only 36x 2-pounder guns (below 48-gun establishment)
- No integral armor support
- Insufficient weapons and equipment in early 1941
- One brigade (24th) short of one battalion in Q1 1941
- Most artillery and cavalry units not yet ready for combat operations

**Desert Adaptations**: Division undergoing intensive training for desert warfare in Palestine and Egypt; adapting to water conservation, vehicle maintenance in sand conditions, dispersed operations, and coordination with British forces

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 8/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Australian tenacity: +1 morale in defensive positions
- Desert rats: Reduced penalties for desert terrain after April 1941
- Volunteer force: High cohesion and unit loyalty bonus
- Commonwealth cooperation: May coordinate with British artillery and support units
- Water discipline: Requires only 60% of standard water supply
- Improvisation: May use captured Italian equipment without penalty during Tobruk siege

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Formation and training scenarios (Palestine, early 1941)
- Siege of Tobruk (April-November 1941)
- Desert defense operations
- Brigade-level counterattacks
- First and Second Battle of El Alamein (1942)
