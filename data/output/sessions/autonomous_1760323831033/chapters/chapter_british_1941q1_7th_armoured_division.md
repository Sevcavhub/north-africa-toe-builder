## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Mobile armoured warfare and exploitation force for Western Desert operations

**Special Capabilities**:
- Desert navigation and long-range mobile operations
- Combined arms cooperation between armor, artillery, and motorized infantry
- Rapid exploitation of breakthrough (demonstrated at Beda Fomm)
- All-arms 'Jock Columns' combining tanks, artillery portée, and infantry

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Combeforce flying column concept - wheeled combined arms force sent across desert to cut off Italian retreat at Beda Fomm
- Portée anti-tank guns for mobile anti-tank defense
- Extensive use of armoured cars for reconnaissance screen
- Desert warfare adaptations including navigation by sun compass

**Known Issues**:
- Tank mechanical reliability after 8 months continuous operations
- Cruiser tanks ineffective against infantry due to AP-only 2-pdr ammunition
- Light tanks obsolescent by 1941 with inadequate armament and armor
- Shortage of replacement tanks and parts by March 1941
- Division withdrawn for complete overhaul after Operation Compass

**Desert Adaptations**: Extensive experience in desert conditions including water discipline, vehicle maintenance in sand, long-range fuel logistics, and navigation. Division pioneered British desert warfare tactics 1940-1941.

- Precise tank variant distribution for 7th Armoured Brigade regiments - brigade had fluid composition with transfers
- Chief of Staff name not found in available sources
- Specific artillery battery designations within RHA regiments
- Exact truck and vehicle counts - estimated from armoured division establishment with 2,500-3,000 vehicles and 460 vehicles per armoured brigade reference
- Small arms quantities estimated from personnel strength using standard British infantry allocation ratios
- Some subordinate unit commanders unknown for Q1 1941 specifically
