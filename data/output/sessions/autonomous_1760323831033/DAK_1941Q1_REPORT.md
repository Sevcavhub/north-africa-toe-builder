## Supply Status

- **Fuel Reserves**: 7 days
- **Ammunition**: 10 days combat supply
- **Water**: 8 liters per day capacity
- **Food**: 14 days rations

**Critical Constraint**: Water supply in desert conditions

---

## Tactical Doctrine

### Role
Mobile Armored Corps for Desert Warfare

### Special Capabilities
- Combined arms coordination (tanks, infantry, artillery)
- Rapid maneuver warfare in desert terrain
- Anti-tank defense using 88mm FlaK guns in direct-fire role
- Reconnaissance-led offensive operations

### Tactical Innovations
- **88mm Innovation**: Use of anti-aircraft guns as devastating anti-tank weapons
- Integrated mobile artillery support
- Combined Kampfgruppe formations mixing unit types
- Aggressive use of reconnaissance to exploit weaknesses

### Known Issues (Q1 1941)
- Extended supply lines vulnerable to interdiction
- Desert conditions causing high mechanical breakdown rates
- Limited water availability requiring extensive logistics
- Tank engines not yet desert-modified causing frequent overheating
- Insufficient spare parts for sustained operations

### Desert Adaptations
Initial deployment with minimal desert modifications. Vehicles equipped with tropical filters being retrofitted. Personnel issued tropical uniforms and helmets. Water supply represents critical constraint on operations.

## Historical Context

### Formation Timeline
- **11 January 1941**: Afrika Korps officially formed
- **11 February 1941**: Rommel designated as commander
- **12 February 1941**: Rommel arrives in Tripoli
- **18 February 1941**: DAK formally established from "Befehlshaber der deutschen Truppen in Libyen"
- **10 February - 12 March 1941**: 5. leichte Division arrives
- **Late March - May 1941**: 15. Panzer-Division begins arriving

### Q1 1941 Operations
- **February 1941**: Arrival and initial deployment in Tripoli
- **March 1941**: El Agheila Offensive begins
- **April 1941**: Capture of Benghazi (technically Q2 but planned in Q1)
- **April 1941**: Siege of Tobruk begins (Q2)

### Experience Level
**Veteran** - Most personnel transferred from experienced divisions:
- 5. leichte Division formed from 3. Panzer-Division elements
- 15. Panzer-Division formed from 33rd Infantry Division and 10. Panzer-Division transfers
- Rommel previously commanded 7. Panzer-Division ("Ghost Division") in France 1940

**Morale Rating**: 9/10

## Known Data Gaps

1. **Squad-Level Detail**: Exact squad-level organization for all companies not fully documented in available sources
2. **Support Unit Vehicles**: Some support unit vehicle allocations estimated based on standard TO&E
3. **15. Panzer-Division Q1 Status**: Division strength in Q1 1941 partial (division arriving throughout March-May)
4. **Corps Support Units**: Corps-level support units (signals, medical, supply) estimated from divisional aggregations
5. **Aircraft**: Aircraft support provided by Luftwaffe units not organically part of DAK (Fliegerkorps X)

---

## Aggregation Methodology

**Status**: Mixed (calculated + manually_entered)

Corps totals aggregated from divisional data where available:
- **5. leichte Division**: Fully deployed in Q1 - data from Panzer-Regiment 5 historical records
- **15. Panzer-Division**: Only partially arrived by end of Q1 (full deployment in Q2)
- **Bottom-up aggregation**: Company → Battalion → Regiment → Division → Corps where source data available
- **Estimates**: Used standard German TO&E for incomplete units and support elements

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: 87%

### Confidence by Category:
- **Command Structure**: 95% (Tessin primary source + multiple confirmations)
- **Tank Equipment**: 90% (Panzer-Regiment 5 detailed records)
- **Personnel Totals**: 85% (Aggregated from divisional strength reports)
- **Artillery**: 85% (Standard TO&E applied to known regiments)
- **Support Vehicles**: 80% (Estimated from standard allocations)
- **Squad Detail**: 75% (Generic TO&E applied where specific data unavailable)

**Minimum Threshold**: 75% - ACHIEVED

## Next Steps Recommendations

To achieve complete bottom-up aggregation from squad to corps level:

1. **Build Division-Level TO&E**:
   - Complete 5. leichte Division detailed breakdown
   - Complete 15. Panzer-Division detailed breakdown

2. **Build Regiment-Level TO&E**:
   - Panzer-Regiment 5 (5. leichte Division)
   - Schützen-Regiment 200 (5. leichte Division)
   - Panzer-Regiment 8 (15. Panzer-Division)
   - Schützen-Regiment 104 (15. Panzer-Division)
   - Schützen-Regiment 115 (15. Panzer-Division)

3. **Build Battalion-Level TO&E**:
   - All panzer battalions (6 total)
   - All Schützen battalions (6+ total)
   - Artillery battalions (6+ total)

4. **Build Company-Level TO&E**:
   - Panzer companies (12+ total)
   - Schützen companies (18+ total)
   - MG companies, mortar companies, etc.

5. **Build Platoon/Squad-Level TO&E**:
   - Individual squad compositions with weapon allocations
   - Enables true bottom-up validation
