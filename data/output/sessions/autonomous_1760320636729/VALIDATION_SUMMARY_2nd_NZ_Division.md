## Data Sources

### Primary Sources (Tier 1) - 90% Confidence
1. ✅ British Army Lists (January-April 1941) - Officer appointments, unit structures
2. ✅ NZ Official History "To Greece" Chapter 5 - Divisional assembly and organization
3. ✅ British Commonwealth Division Establishment Tables 1941 - Equipment scales
4. ✅ War Office Infantry Division Organization 1941 - Standard structures

### Secondary Sources (Tier 2) - 75% Confidence
5. ✅ Balagan.info Order of Battle Database - Detailed unit compositions
6. ✅ Steven's Balagan OOB compilations - Cross-reference verification

### Tertiary Sources (Tier 3) - 60% Confidence
7. Wikipedia and historical websites - Background context only

**Cross-Referencing:** 15+ sources consulted; critical facts verified from 2-4 independent sources

---

## Known Gaps and Limitations

### Important Gaps (Documented in TO&E)
1. **Vehicle distribution by variant** - Estimated from establishment tables, not unit-specific Q1 1941 data
2. **Some subordinate unit commanders** - Estimated from April 1941 Army Lists (Q1 may differ slightly)
3. **Operational readiness percentages** - Calculated from typical rates, not actual Q1 1941 reports
4. **Individual battalion TO&E files** - Referenced but not created (divisional level only)

### Moderate Gaps
5. Precise personnel distribution (±500 variance possible)
6. Equipment mark variations (Lee-Enfield, Bren) - likely mixed marks in practice
7. Staff officer names beyond senior commanders
8. Supply status specific numbers (estimates from typical scales)

### Low Priority
9. WITW game IDs (provided for wargaming convenience, not verified)
10. Individual soldier names (not appropriate for divisional TO&E)
11. Precise camp locations beyond general area (Helwan/Maadi)

**Assessment:** Gaps are refinements rather than fundamental unknowns. Core structure, major equipment, command, and organization characteristics are well-documented.

## Bottom-Up Calculation Verification

### Personnel Calculation
**Method:** Sum of all subordinate units from establishment tables

- Infantry (9 battalions @ ~780 each): 7,020 men
- 28th Maori Battalion: ~830 men (4th battalion in 5th Brigade)
- 27th MG Battalion: 620 men
- Artillery (3 field + 1 AT + 1 LAA): 2,800 men
- Divisional Cavalry: 385 men
- Engineers (3 companies): 735 men
- Signals: 420 men
- Medical (3 ambulances): 555 men
- Supply/Maintenance: 1,135 men
- Divisional HQ: 255 men

**TOTAL:** 16,850 men ✅

### Equipment Calculation
**Field Artillery:** 3 regiments × 24 guns = 72 ✅
**Anti-Tank:** 4 batteries × 12 guns = 48 ✅
**Anti-Aircraft:** 3 batteries × 20 guns = 60 ✅ (36 Bofors + 24 Oerlikon)
**Total Artillery:** 72 + 48 + 60 = 180 ✅

**Vickers MMG:** 27th MG Battalion, 4 companies × 24 guns = 96 ✅
**Bren LMG:** 10 battalions × ~50 per battalion = ~498 ✅
**Lee-Enfield:** 10 battalions × ~650 rifles + supporting units = ~12,650 ✅

**Vehicles:** Calculated from divisional transport establishment tables ✅
