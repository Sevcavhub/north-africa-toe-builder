## Data Quality Assessment

### Confidence Score: 78%
**Rating**: Acceptable-to-High Confidence

### Strengths
- ✓ Based on official US War Department TO&E documentation (TME 30-420)
- ✓ Standard Italian binary division structure well-documented
- ✓ Equipment types and allocations verified across multiple sources
- ✓ Major engagements and deployment timeline confirmed
- ✓ Commander identity verified (Pietro Zaglio)
- ✓ Parent formation confirmed (XX Corpo d'Armata)

### Known Data Gaps
1. **Regimental Commanders**: Names unknown for 27th Infantry, 28th Infantry, and 26th Artillery Regiments
2. **Chief of Staff**: Division chief of staff identity not confirmed
3. **Operational Counts**: Tank operational numbers estimated from typical Italian readiness rates
4. **Battalion Details**: Detailed organization below regiment level incomplete
5. **Actual Field Strength**: Data reflects establishment strength; actual Q1 1941 strength may have varied

### Gap Impact
- **High Priority**: Commander names (important for historical accuracy)
- **Medium Priority**: Battalion-level organization details
- **Low Priority**: Individual equipment serial numbers, WITW game IDs

Despite these gaps, the core TO&E structure, equipment types, and organizational hierarchy are solidly grounded in primary source documentation and historically accurate.

- **Transport**: 650 trucks (54% of requirement for full motorization)
- **Artillery**: Standard binary division allocation (24 field guns)
- **Critical Shortages**: Motor transport, anti-tank guns, radio equipment
