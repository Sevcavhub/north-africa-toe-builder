## Supply Status

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 8 | Low |
| Ammunition | 10 | Low |
| Food | 14 | Low |
| Water | 53250 L/day | Adequate |

**Assessment**: Supply situation improving as division rebuilds from Operation Compass losses. Rommel's offensive (April-May 1941) secured supply lines. Division transitioning to siege operations at Tobruk.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Semi-motorized infantry division recovering from Operation Compass losses (December 1940-February 1941). Participated in Rommel's offensive (April-May 1941) and transitioning to siege operations around Tobruk fortress.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Desert operations experience (combat-veteran)
- Light tank battalion provides limited mobile firepower
- Semi-motorized structure (AS type) for operational mobility
- Binary division organization (2 regiments)
- Experienced in defensive operations

**Tactical Innovations**:
- AS (Africa Settentrionale) organization optimized for North African operations
- Integrated light tank battalion at division level
- Motorized support structure for desert mobility
- Siege warfare adaptations (beginning April 1941)

**Known Issues**:
- Still recovering from heavy casualties in Operation Compass
- L3/35 tankettes inadequate against British armor
- Limited anti-tank capability (47/32mm insufficient vs. British Matilda II)
- Water supply critical constraint in desert
- Equipment partially replaced but not at full strength
- Carcano rifle range/accuracy inferior to Lee-Enfield
- Breda M30 LMG reliability issues in desert conditions
- Morale recovering but still affected by recent defeats

**Desert Adaptations**: AS-type organization with enhanced motor transport. Division gained siege warfare experience during Tobruk operations. Vehicle sand filters essential. Water discipline strictly enforced. Desert camouflage patterns adopted.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

**Theater**: North Africa - Cyrenaica, Libya (Tobruk sector)

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 5/10
**Experience Level**: Regular (combat-experienced)

**Special Rules**:
- Recovering from casualties: -5% effectiveness
- Vulnerable to British armor
- Water supply critical (reduce effectiveness if water scarce)
- L3/35 tankettes ineffective vs. armored vehicles
- Breda M30 reliability: -1 to LMG effectiveness in prolonged combat
- Siege warfare experience: +1 to defensive positions
- Better cohesion than Q1 under new leadership

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Rommel's first offensive (April-May 1941)
- Siege of Tobruk (beginning April 1941)
- Operation Brevity (May 1941)
- Defense of Cyrenaica
- Desert patrol and reconnaissance actions
- Static defensive positions

## Data Quality & Known Gaps
