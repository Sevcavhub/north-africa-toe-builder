## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Indian Infantry Division - general purpose infantry formation for offensive and defensive operations in colonial theaters

**Special Capabilities**:
- Experienced in East Africa campaign with victory at Battle of Keren (February-April 1941)
- Mixed British and Indian battalions providing cultural and tactical flexibility
- Mountain warfare capability with 24th Indian Mountain Regiment
- Proven ability to operate in harsh terrain and climate conditions
- Strong artillery support with 72 x 25-pdr field guns plus mountain artillery

**Known Issues**:
- Battle of Keren caused heavy casualties (approximately 500 officers and 3,000 men across 4th and 5th Divisions)
- Division required rest and reinforcement after intensive Eritrea operations
- 2-pounder anti-tank gun adequate for Italian armor but would be insufficient for German Panzers
- Supply lines extended from Port Sudan made logistics challenging

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 8/10
**Experience Level**: Veteran

**Special Rules**:
- Keren Veterans: +1 morale in mountain/rough terrain combat
- Mixed British-Indian Force: British battalions provide stiffening, Indian battalions provide numbers
- Mountain Artillery: 24th Mountain Regiment can deploy in terrain impassable to field artillery
- Strong Artillery: 72 x 25-pdr plus 24 x mountain howitzers provides excellent fire support
- East Africa Experience: +1 to operations in hot climate, rough terrain

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- 1941 Battle of Keren (January-April 1941)
- 1941 Advance to Asmara and Massawa (April 1941)
- 1941 Final East Africa operations (May-June 1941)
- 1941-1942 Iraq and Syria operations (post-Q2)
