## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Infantry Division (Commonwealth) - Defensive Operations

**Special Capabilities**:
- Experienced in defensive operations and fortification
- High morale and determination ('Rats of Tobruk')
- Effective night raiding and patrolling
- Adaptation to desert warfare conditions
- Strong combined-arms coordination with British artillery

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Aggressive patrolling to disrupt German siege operations
- Use of captured Italian fortifications and defensive positions
- Night raids to harass Axis forces
- Effective use of limited anti-tank resources

**Known Issues**:
- Shortage of modern anti-tank guns during Q2 1941
- Limited armored support (no divisional tank regiment)
- Artillery regiments (2/4th, 2/8th) not present - deployed to Syria
- Cavalry regiment (9th Div Cav) detached in June for Syria campaign
- Shortage of machine guns, mortars, and carriers at start of siege

**Desert Adaptations**: Division adapted well to desert conditions during Tobruk siege. Developed effective water conservation measures, dust control for weapons, and utilization of captured Italian supplies and equipment.
