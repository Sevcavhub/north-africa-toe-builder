## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Main infantry assault force for Operation Compass (9-11 December 1940). Executed breakthrough attacks on Italian fortified camps at Sidi Barrani. After victory, division rapidly transferred to Sudan (12 Dec onwards) for East African Campaign.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Combat-proven in Operation Compass offensive operations
- Successful combined arms coordination (infantry-tank cooperation with 7th RTR)
- Rapid strategic redeployment capability (Western Desert to Sudan in 16 days)
- Mixed British and Indian battalions providing tactical flexibility
- Reinforced with British 16th Infantry Brigade through 14 December

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Night approach march followed by dawn assault (Nibeiwa attack)
- Close infantry-tank cooperation with Matilda II tanks (7th RTR)
- Rapid exploitation after breakthrough (Nibeiwa to Tummar same day)
- Sequential brigade attacks maintaining momentum

**Known Issues**:
- No organic tank support - dependent on British armored units
- Limited anti-aircraft defenses against Italian air attacks
- Rapid redeployment to Sudan reduced time for rest after combat
- 16th Brigade detached immediately after Operation Compass (14 Dec)

**Desert Adaptations**: Division executed first major British offensive in Western Desert with complete success. Destroyed Italian Maletti Group at Nibeiwa and captured multiple fortified camps. Demonstrated effective desert warfare doctrine combining speed, surprise, and combined arms coordination.
