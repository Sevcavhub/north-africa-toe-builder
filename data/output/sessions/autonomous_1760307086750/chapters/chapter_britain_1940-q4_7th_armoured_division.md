| Fuel | 10 | Low |
| Ammunition | 15 | Adequate |
| Food | 18 | Adequate |
| Water | 82000 L/day | Minimal |

**Assessment**: Operational tempo during Operation Compass - supply lines stretched during rapid advance

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Primary mobile striking force for Operation Compass offensive against Italian 10th Army

**Special Capabilities**:
- High-speed mobile desert warfare
- Combined arms armoured operations
- Deep reconnaissance and screening
- Encirclement and exploitation operations
- Night movement and navigation in desert

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Armoured brigade 'jock columns' (combined arms battlegroups)
- Extensive use of armoured cars for deep reconnaissance
- Mobile Support Group providing flexible combined arms
- Desert navigation using sun compass and dead reckoning
- Rapid exploitation following breakthrough

**Known Issues**:
- Tank mechanical reliability in desert conditions - 30 of 195 non-operational
- Limited tank recovery and repair capabilities during rapid advance
- Light tank (Mk VI) inadequate for combat - used only for recce
- Supply lines stretched during rapid exploitation phase
- Cruiser tank gun traverse slow compared to Italian tanks
- Dust problems affecting engines and vision devices

**Desert Adaptations**: Enhanced water capacity, improved air filters (partially), desert navigation equipment, light desert uniforms, modified camouflage nets for desert use
