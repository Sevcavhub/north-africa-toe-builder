This was the division's first major offensive operation, launching the brilliant British counter-offensive that destroyed the Italian 10th Army. The 'Desert Rats' performed their legendary role as the Western Desert Force's main striking arm. Major-General Creagh commanded the division through rapid exploitation operations covering hundreds of miles. The division's tank strength (~195) represents its share of WDF's 275 tanks, excluding the 48 Matildas of 7th RTR (corps troops). The force demonstrated exceptional mobility, navigation, and combined arms capability in defeating a numerically superior Italian force. Note that 6th RTR was detached to Selby Force, and 3rd/8th Hussars left brigade in mid-January 1941 as operations progressed."
