### Historical Accuracy

✅ **Commander:** Pietro Maggiani (Generale di Divisione) - CONFIRMED

- Artillery regiment 12° SILA - LOST during Operation Compass (winter 1940-41)
- Typical Italian division support units

✅ **Strength:** 10,864 personnel (85% of 12,800 establishment)
- Reflects post-Operation Compass recovery status
- Documented personnel transfers to frontline 10th Army

✅ **Location:** Gharyan garrison, Tripolitania, Libya (Q1 1941)

4. Precise fate of 12° Artiglieria SILA (confirmed lost, details unclear)

**Moderate Gaps:**
5. Exact personnel count (estimated 85% establishment)
6. Equipment operational readiness rates estimated
7. Supply stockpile quantities estimated
8. Signal equipment losses quantified generally but not precisely

**Low Priority:**
