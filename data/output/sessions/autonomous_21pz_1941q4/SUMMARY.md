## Validation Notes

### Known Limitations
1. **Tessin Source:** Limited detail for North African units compared to European theater formations
2. **Personnel Fluctuations:** Numbers represent October 1941; significant casualties during November-December
3. **Equipment Attrition:** Operational readiness declined from 69% (October) to <50% (December)
4. **Captured Equipment:** British/Italian vehicles integrated opportunistically; formal records incomplete
5. **Supply Data:** Calculated from operational reports rather than specific quartermaster records

### Aggregation Status
**Manually entered** - Division-level TO&E constructed from historical sources

**Future Work:** Develop detailed subordinate unit TO&Es (Panzer-Regiment 5, Schützen-Regimenter 104/155, etc.) for bottom-up validation

---

## Wargaming Data

### Morale Rating
**8/10** - Veteran formation with high combat motivation, reduced slightly by supply difficulties

### Experience Level
**Veteran** - Most personnel combat-experienced; excellent NCO quality

### Special Rules Generated
1. **Fuel Shortages** - Random fuel availability affects movement
2. **Desert Warriors** - +1 initiative and navigation
3. **88mm Supremacy** - Extended range and penetration for 88mm Flak guns
4. **Captured Equipment** - May utilize British vehicles and supplies
5. **Water Critical** - Supply line requirements for desert operations
6. **Combined Arms Bonus** - German doctrine excellence bonus

### Recommended Scenarios
- Operation Crusader (division-corps level)
- Battle of Sidi Rezegh (battalion-brigade level)
- Tobruk perimeter attacks (company-battalion level)
- Gambut-Bardia area encounters (battalion-regiment level)
