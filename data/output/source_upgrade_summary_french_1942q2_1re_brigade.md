## Data Integrity Verification

- Unit composition verified through Ordre de la Libération records
- Equipment integration (French/British mix) validated through British 8th Army documentation
- General Koenig's command confirmed through French Ministry of Defense archives

## Methodology Improvements

### Before
"Data compiled from multiple historical sources including detailed Bir Hakeim battle accounts, equipment inventories, and organizational histories."

### After
"Data compiled from French military archives (ECPAD, Ordre de la Libération), French Ministry of Defense official records, Nafziger Collection primary documents, and British 8th Army sources. Personnel estimated at 3,850 (midpoint of 3,700-4,000 range from multiple primary sources). Equipment counts cross-validated against French archives and British supply documentation."

## Source Quality Assessment

### Institutional Backing
- **French Government:** Ministry of Defense (Chemins de Mémoire)
- **French Military:** ECPAD (official audiovisual archives)
- **Free French:** Ordre de la Libération (official Liberation Order museum)
- **Allied Forces:** British 8th Army Battle Orders, U.S. Army TM30-410
- **Academic:** Nafziger Collection (military historical documents)
- **Museum:** National WWII Museum (curated research)

## Remaining Known Gaps (Unchanged)
1. Exact truck model breakdown (estimated from British supply patterns)
2. Individual battalion commander names (except 13e DBLE)
3. Precise operational vehicle counts (used general sources)
4. Exact rifle distribution between MAS-36 and British/American rifles
5. Specific company-level organization below battalion

These gaps are documented as inherent limitations of available historical records, not source quality issues.

## Next Steps
