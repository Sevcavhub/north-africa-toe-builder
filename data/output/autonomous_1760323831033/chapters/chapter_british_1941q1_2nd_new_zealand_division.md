**Assessment**: Division well-supplied in Egypt January 1941; severe shortages developed during Greece/Crete campaigns March-May 1941

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Premier Commonwealth infantry division optimized for mobile desert warfare and defensive operations

**Special Capabilities**:
- Highly aggressive infantry tactics with emphasis on night attacks
- Strong esprit de corps from volunteer force
- Excellent marksmanship and fieldcraft
- Effective combined arms coordination (infantry-artillery)

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Rapid deployment from Egypt to Greece (March 1941)
- Skilled defensive delaying actions (Olympus Pass, Greece)
- Effective use of limited armor (Universal Carriers) in reconnaissance

**Known Issues**:
- Limited organic armor - no tank support
- Anti-tank capability limited to 2-pounder guns and Boys rifles (inadequate vs German armor)
- Anti-aircraft defense limited (only 16 Bofors guns)
- Severe equipment losses during Greece/Crete evacuations (April-May 1941)

**Desert Adaptations**: Division trained extensively in Egyptian desert January-March 1941 before Greece deployment; experienced in water discipline, navigation, vehicle maintenance in extreme conditions
