## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Static defense of Halfaya Pass and Sollum-Bardia line during Operation Crusader

- Desert operations experience (since 1940)
- Tenacious defense under siege conditions

**Known Issues**:
- Critical personnel losses (33% from Q1 strength)
- Ammunition shortages - only 12 days remaining
- Water crisis - reduced to 55,000 liters/day for 7,385 men
- Food shortages - only 9 days remaining
- Encircled and cut off from resupply since early December
- Heavy vehicle losses (29% trucks, 30% motorcycles)
- Artillery losses (25% of all guns)
- No armor capability
- Limited mobility due to vehicle losses
- Blackshirt legion at 28% strength

**Desert Adaptations**: Division has excellent desert experience but is now besieged at Halfaya Pass with deteriorating supply situation. Water supply critical.
