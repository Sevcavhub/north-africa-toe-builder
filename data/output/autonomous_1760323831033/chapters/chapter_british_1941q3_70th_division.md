## Supply Status

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |

| Food | 25 | Adequate |
| Water | 420000 L/day | Adequate |

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Fortress garrison and breakout force

**Special Capabilities**:
- Static defense of fortified positions
- Combined arms coordination with armor
- Night operations and raids
- Desert warfare experience
- Multi-national coordination (British, Polish, Czechoslovak forces)

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Integration of captured Italian artillery into fire plans
- Adaptive defense in depth using existing Italian fortifications
- Coordinated breakout operations with external relief forces

**Known Issues**:
- Limited mobility due to fortress defense role
- Supply constraints from siege conditions
- Mixed equipment including obsolete and captured weapons
- High exposure to artillery and air attack in open desert fortress

**Desert Adaptations**: Extensive experience in desert siege warfare. Units adapted to water rationing (15 liters per man per day vs 30 liter standard). Use of Italian defensive positions and incorporation of captured equipment. Mastery of defensive minefield employment and night patrol operations.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 8/10
**Experience Level**: Veteran

**Special Rules**:
- Fortress Defense: +1 to defensive positions in prepared fortifications
- Desert Rats: Immune to desert terrain movement penalties
- Mixed Equipment: -1 to logistics/supply rolls due to non-standard equipment
- Siege Hardened: +1 morale when surrounded or defending
- Royal Navy Supply: Can be resupplied by naval forces if coastal hex controlled

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Siege of Tobruk (April-December 1941)
- Operation Crusader breakout (November 1941)
- Defense of Ed Duda corridor (November-December 1941)
- Static defense scenarios
- Combined British-Polish operations
