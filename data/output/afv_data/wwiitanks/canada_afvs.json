It was commonly called a Cromwell IV.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 96 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Cromwell tank was designed as a heavy cruiser tank that could rapidly move and provide good A/T performance, in appearance it looked like the Cavalier.The vehicle had a rear Rolls Royce Meteor engine producing 600hp driving the tracks, towards the main front idler over the 5 large road wheels, round the idler and back under the roadwheels in the standard Christie style.The Mark IV was a Centaur Mk III with the 75mm gun in the turret and the Meteor engine added.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.",

It was commonly called a Cromwell VII.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 114 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Cromwell tank was designed as a heavy cruiser tank that could rapidly move and provide good A/T performance, in appearance it looked like the Cavalier.The vehicle had a rear Rolls Royce Meteor engine producing 600hp driving the tracks, towards the main front idler over the 5 large road wheels, round the idler and back under the roadwheels in the standard Christie style.The Mark VII was the final version of the Cromwell with added armour, wider tracks and a lower ratio final drive.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.",

It was commonly called a Churchill  1 - I.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 48 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The turret contained the 2pdr gun and a 3 inch howitzer in the hull front.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Churchill  2 - II.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 67 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The turret contained the 2pdr gun and the 3 inch howitzer in the hull front on the A22 was replaced by a besa machine gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939. The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk.

It was commonly called a Churchill  3 - III.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 6pdr 7cwt MKI-III which could penetrate 105 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkIII had a welded turret which held the 6pdr gun as the 2pdr was becoming obsolete as a tank gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 6pdr 7cwt MKI-III(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe 6pdr Mk II—differed from the pre-production Mk I in having a shorter L/43 barrel, because of shortage of suitable lathes.

The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkIV had a cast turret which held the 6pdr gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 6pdr 7cwt MKI-III(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe 6pdr Mk II—differed from the pre-production Mk I in having a shorter L/43 barrel, because of shortage of suitable lathes.

It was commonly called a Churchill  6 - VI.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 96 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkVI was upgraded to use the 75mm gun replacing the 6pdr.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell.

It was commonly called a Churchill  7 - VIII.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 85 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkVII this was a major redesign with a new turret firing the 75mm and redesigned hull and massively thicker armour than the MkVI.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell.

It was commonly called a Churchill  8 - VIII.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkVII this was a major redesign with a new turret firing the 75mm and redesigned hull and massively thicker armour than the MkVI.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm",

It was commonly called a Churchill  9 - IX.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkIX classified were reworked older vehicles usually MkIII with additional applique armour to bring them up to MkVII levels of armour, and armed with the 75mm gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm",

It was commonly called a Churchill 11 - XI.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkXI classified were reworked older vehicles usually MkVI with additional applique armour to bring them up to MkVII levels of armour, and armed with the 75mm gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm",

The Kangaroo was one of the first Armoured Personnell carriers used by the allies. One hundred and three were originally produced by the removal of the 25pdr howitzer from the obsolete M7 Priest SP Artillery vehicle, modified with a welded armour plate where the gun originally was located. These were so successful that further models were produced based on the RAM chassis. The first conversions were made in June 1944 and carried 12 troops and significantly helping to reduce the casualties with troops accompanying the tank forces.       \n Armour Details\n TurretFrontn/aSiden/aRearn/aTopn/a SuperstructureFront87mm@45°(123mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) \n        HullFront87mm@45°(123mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 123 mm - Minimum 13 mm",

It was commonly called a Stuart VI.The vehicle was powered by Cadillac 'Series 42' petrol powerplant producing 220 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 40 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 24 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4s. Its main armament consisted  of a 37mm Antitank Gun M3 which could penetrate 64 mm of flat plate at 200 metres Its main armament consisted  and a 37mm Antitank Gun M6 which could penetrate 64 mm of flat plate at 200 metres.The Light tank M3 Stuart VI was a tank based on the M2A4 with the 37mm anti tank gun having a gyrostabiliser.\n\nThe power was provided by twin Cadillac 121hp petrol engines, driving through the front drive wheel, then via 2 pairs of road wheels to a rear idler then back over 3 return rollers.\n\nThis model was all welded for better protection .      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront51mm@0°(51mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) SuperstructureFront57mm@45°(81mm)Side28mm@0°(28mm)Rear28mm@0°(28mm)Top9mm@90°(9mm) \n        HullFront57mm@45°(81mm)Side28mm@0°(28mm)Rear28mm@0°(28mm)Top9mm@90°(9mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 81 mm - Minimum 9 mm  Weapon Details\n\n37mm Antitank Gun M3(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed against the Japanese in the Phillipines in 1941, and proved effective, however when used in the North Africa Campaign the shells bounced off the German medium tanks.

It was commonly called a Stuart.The vehicle was powered by Cadilac 'Series 42' petrol powerplant producing 220 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 40 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 24 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4s. Its main armament consisted  of a 37mm Antitank Gun M3 which could penetrate 56 mm of flat plate at 400 metres Its main armament consisted  and a 37mm Antitank Gun M6 which could penetrate 56 mm of flat plate at 400 metres.The Light tank M5A1 was a tank based on the M5 with the 37mm anti tank gun having a gyrostabiliser. \n\nThe power was provided by twin Cadillac 121hp petrol engines, driving through the front drive wheel, then via 2 pairs of road wheels to a rear idler then back over 3 return rollers.\n\nThis model was all welded and had a bulge at the rear of the turret for a radio.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront51mm@0°(51mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top12mm@90°(12mm) SuperstructureFront57mm@45°(81mm)Side28mm@0°(28mm)Rear28mm@0°(28mm)Top9mm@90°(9mm) \n        HullFront57mm@45°(81mm)Side28mm@0°(28mm)Rear28mm@0°(28mm)Top9mm@90°(9mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 81 mm - Minimum 9 mm  Weapon Details\n\n37mm Antitank Gun M3(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed against the Japanese in the Phillipines in 1941, and proved effective, however when used in the North Africa Campaign the shells bounced off the German medium tanks.

It was commonly called a Sherman II.The vehicle was powered by Continental 'R957C1' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 24 mph with a range of about 120 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 48 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4s. Its main armament consisted  of a 75mm Gun M3 L/40 which could penetrate 92 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Sherman II M4A1 was a similar shape to the M4 but had a curved cast hull which provided less flat surfaces for AT hits, this was mostly noticable at the top of the hull next to the turret.\n\nThe cast turret carrying the gyro stabilised 75mm Gun M3 was the same as that of the Sherman I.\n\nIt was driven by a Continental 350HP air cooled engine with the drive sprocket at the front, the track went under 3 double bogie wheels onto the idler, then back over 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@0°(75mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront50mm@45°(71mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 75 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\n75mm Gun M3 L/40 \n            \nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/40\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.32Kg 619M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 70mm@500m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.7\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n95\n88\n79\n70\n61\n52\n45\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n110\n102\n92\n81\n71\n61\n52\n44\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range 5000 Mtr\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.85\n4.36\n8\n13.72\n24.01\n48.06\n168.4\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

Its main armament consisted  of a 76mm Gun M1 L/55 which could penetrate 149 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Sherman IIA M4A1 was a similar shape to the M4 but had a curved cast hull which provided less flat surfaces for AT hits, this was mostly noticable at the top of the hull next to the turret.\n\nThe cast turret carrying the gyro stabilised 76mm Gun M1A1 with a squarer mantlet than the M4 was the same as that of the Sherman IA.\n\nIt was driven by a Continental 350HP air cooled engine with the drive sprocket at the front, the track went under 3 double bogie wheels onto the idler, then back over 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront65mm@0°(65mm)Side65mm@0°(65mm)Rear65mm@0°(65mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront65mm@45°(92mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top14mm@90°(14mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 92 mm - Minimum 14 mm  Weapon Details\n\n76mm Gun M1 L/55 \n            \nCalibre76.20mm\nLengthL/55\nNumber of Rounds 72\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.8Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 88mm@1000m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.26\n0.53\n1.13\n1.8\n2.56\n3.42\n4.42\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n129\n119\n109\n96\n84\n72\n62\n52\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n149\n138\n126\n111\n97\n84\n72\n61\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n96\n77\n44\n25\n15\n\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

Its main armament consisted  of a 75mm Gun M3 L/40 which could penetrate 81 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The Sherman V M4A4 was a similar shape to the M4 but had a lengthened welded hull and was powered by the Ordnance RD-1820 engine producing 497HP.\n\nThe cast turret carrying the gyro stabilised 75mm Gun M3 was the same as that of the Sherman I.\nAs with the earlier Sherman I the drive sprocket was at the front, the track went under 3 double bogie wheels onto the idler, then back over 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@0°(75mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront50mm@45°(71mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 75 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\n75mm Gun M3 L/40 \n            \nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/40\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.32Kg 619M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 70mm@500m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.7\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n95\n88\n79\n70\n61\n52\n45\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n110\n102\n92\n81\n71\n61\n52\n44\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range 5000 Mtr\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.85\n4.36\n8\n13.72\n24.01\n48.06\n168.4\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 48 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The Ram I Cruiser tank was developed by the Canadians utilising the engine and drive chain from the American M3 Grant with a new cast upper hull and turret. Originally designed to take the 6pdr gun, these early models had a 2pdr gun as the 6pdr wasn't available in time. Fifty of these vehicles were produced between Autumn 1941 and early 1942 by the Montreal Locomotive Works, most of which were shipped to England. The vehicle transmission sprocket was at the front, the track passed under 6 road wheels on three bogies to the rear idler, then return via 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront87mm@47°(128mm)Side63mm@5°(63mm)Rear51mm@5°(51mm)Top22mm@90°(22mm) SuperstructureFront87mm@45°(123mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) \n        HullFront87mm@45°(123mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 128 mm - Minimum 13 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939. The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk. However the 2pdr manufacture was continued but was slowly replaced by the 6pdr from 1942.\nManufactured1936 - 1944\nCalibre40mm\nLengthL/50\nRate of Fire22 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP/T Mk I\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 40mm 1.08Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 53mm@455m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.58\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n64\n58\n51\n41\n33\n25\n19\n13\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n74\n67\n59\n48\n39\n30\n22\n16\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE/T Mk II after 1942\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 40mm 0.86Kg 792M/Sec 0.085Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill1 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill3 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill9 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr0 mm\nAn explosion within 1 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 9 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will not cause any significant armour damage.",

Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 6pdr 7cwt MKI-III which could penetrate 86 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Ram II Cruiser tank was developed by the Canadians utilising the engine and drive chain from the American M3 Grant with a cast upper hull and turret together with a number of improvements over the Ram I. The Ram II was armed with the originally designed 6pdr gun, the earlier Ram I had to make do with the 2pdr gun as the 6pdr wasn't available at the time. 1899 of these vehicles were produced between early 1942 and 1943 by the Montreal Locomotive Works, most of which were again shipped to England as were the Ram I vehicles.

The Ram Command/OP tank was developed by the Canadians utilising the engine and drive chain from the American M3 Grant with a cast upper hull and turret together with a number of improvements over the Ram I. The Ram Command/OP was built on the Ram II chassis with the 6pdr gun removed to allow for the command staff and additional communication equipment. 84 of these vehicles were produced in 1943 by the Montreal Locomotive Works, most of which were again shipped to England as were the other Ram vehicles. The vehicle transmission sprocket was at the front, the track passed under 6 road wheels on three bogies to the rear idler, then return via 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront87mm@47°(128mm)Side63mm@5°(63mm)Rear51mm@5°(51mm)Top22mm@90°(22mm) SuperstructureFront87mm@45°(123mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) \n        HullFront87mm@45°(123mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 128 mm - Minimum 13 mm",
