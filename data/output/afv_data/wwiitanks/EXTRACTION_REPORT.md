## Data Quality

### ✅ Strengths (v2.1 Enhanced)

1. **Complete Source Provenance**
   - Every record has unique ID
   - Every record has source URL
   - Every record has scrape timestamp
   - Every record has scraper version identifier
   - Every record has standardized country code

2. **Rich Metadata (AFVs)**
   - Indicators for photos, illustrations, history
   - Nested specifications (general_details, specifications, general_information)
   - Weapon details with penetration tables
   - Armor details with angles and thicknesses
   - Image URLs preserved

3. **Properly Structured Gun Data (v2.1)**
   - Ammunition arrays with multiple types per gun
   - Penetration tables with 8 range entries per ammunition
   - Queryable specs (calibre, weight, muzzle velocity) per ammunition
   - Normalized ammunition types (AP, AP40, HE, HEAT)
   - Enables AFV ↔ Gun effectiveness calculations

4. **Data Separation**
   - Completely separate from OnWar.com data
   - Dedicated `wwiitanks/` subdirectory
   - No data mixing or collision
   - Ready for future merge phase

5. **Reliability Features**
   - Browser restart every 3 countries prevents timeouts
   - Resume capability prevents data loss
   - Incremental per-country saves
   - Error handling continues on individual failures

### ⚠️ Issues (All Fixed in v2.1)

1. **~~Pagination Not Handled~~** ✅ FIXED
   - ~~AFV extraction incomplete for major nations~~
   - ✅ All 612 AFVs extracted with full pagination support
   - ✅ All 7 pages extracted for Germany (204 vehicles)
   - ✅ All 5 pages extracted for Britain (125 vehicles)

2. **~~Gun Data Structure Inconsistency~~** ✅ FIXED in v2.1
   - ~~Some fields have extremely long keys (entire HTML scraped)~~
   - ✅ Properly structured ammunition arrays
   - ✅ Penetration tables parsed into objects
   - ✅ Clean, queryable JSON structure

3. **Minor Remaining Issues (Non-blocking)**
   - AFV data: Some fields still have long keys (v1 scraper, low priority to fix)
   - AFV data: Image list includes advertising banners
   - Gun data: HE ammunition sometimes detected twice (nested tables)
   - Gun data: Blast effects not fully captured for HE rounds
   - Gun data: Vehicle relationships not in main table (separate scrape needed)

## Gun Data Quality Enhancement (v2.1)

### Problem with v1 Gun Scraper

The initial gun scraper (v1) had severe data quality issues:

**Data Structure Problem:**
- Complex gun pages (e.g., [5.0cm Pak 38](https://wwiitanks.co.uk/FORM-Gun_Data.php?I=114)) have multiple ammunition types with penetration tables
- v1 scraper concatenated ALL ammunition data into ONE massive 2,770-character field name
- No separation between ammunition types (AP, AP40, HE, HEAT)
- Penetration tables completely unparsed
- Random numeric fragments scattered across different fields

**Example of v1 Data Quality Issue:**
```json
{
  "5.0cm PzGr. 39 L/60 (AP Armor Piercing) 50mm 2.06kg... [2,770 more characters]": "100m",
  "0.12": "84",
  "97": "98"
}
```

**Why This Was Unacceptable:**
- Cannot programmatically determine which ammunition is available for a gun
- Cannot calculate AFV ↔ Gun effectiveness (e.g., "Can a Pak 38 penetrate a Matilda at 500m?")
- Cannot extract muzzle velocity, weight, or other specs per ammunition type
- Simple gun pages (e.g., [37mm Gun Type 94](https://wwiitanks.co.uk/FORM-Gun_Data.php?I=360)) worked fine
- But 80%+ of guns have complex multi-ammunition tables

### v2.1 Enhanced Scraper Solution

**Proper Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "gun_name": "5.0cm Pak 38 L/60",
  "ammunition": [
    {
      "name": "5.0cm PzGr. 39 L/60",
      "type": "AP",
      "type_full": "AP Armor Piercing",
      "specs": {
        "calibre": "50mm",
        "weight_kg": 2.06,
        "muzzle_velocity_m_s": 840
      },
      "penetration_table": [
        {
          "range_m": 100,
          "flight_time_s": 0.12,
          "penetration_30deg_mm": 84,
          "penetration_0deg_mm": 97,
          "hit_probability_pct": 98
        },
        // ... 7 more range entries (100m, 200m, 300m, 500m, 750m, 1000m, 1500m, 2000m)
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "5.0cm PzGr. 40 L/60",
      "type": "AP40",
      "type_full": "AP40 Tungsten Core",
      "specs": {
        "calibre": "50mm",
        "weight_kg": 0.925,
        "muzzle_velocity_m_s": 1180
      },
      "penetration_table": [
        // ... 8 range entries with penetration data
      ]
    }
    // ... HE and HEAT ammunition types
  ]
}
```

**Section-Aware Parsing Implementation:**

1. **TH Element Detection** - Fixed DOM parsing for non-standard table layouts
   - Website uses empty TD spacers before TH labels
   - Changed from `allCells[0]` (incorrect) to `allCells.find(cell => cell.tagName === 'TH')` (correct)

2. **Ammunition Header Recognition** - Regex pattern matching
   - Pattern: `/^\d+\.?\d*\s*cm\s*.+/` with parentheses containing type (AP, AP40, HE, HEAT)
   - Extracts ammunition name, full type description, and normalized type code

3. **Specification Parsing** - Per-ammunition extraction
   - Calibre (mm)
   - Weight (kg)
   - Muzzle velocity (m/s)
   - Extracted from TD cells following TH header

4. **Penetration Table Parsing** - Multi-row table extraction
   - 8 standard ranges: 100m, 200m, 300m, 500m, 750m, 1000m, 1500m, 2000m
   - 4 data points per range: range, flight time, penetration at 30°, penetration at 0°, hit probability
   - Properly structured as array of objects

### Browser Restart and Resume Capability

**Problem:** Puppeteer timeout after ~35 minutes of continuous scraping

**Solution:**
1. **Auto-restart browser every 3 countries** to prevent protocol timeouts
2. **Resume capability** - Check for completed country files, skip and load existing data
3. **Increased protocol timeout** from 60s to 180s (3 minutes)
4. **Incremental per-country file saves** - Data loss limited to current country on crash
5. **Error handling** - Continue on individual failures instead of crashing entire scrape

**Browser Restarts During Full Scrape:**
- After Denmark (restart 1)
- After Germany (restart 2)
- After Japan (restart 3)
- After Sweden (restart 4)
- After USA (restart 5)

**Total Duration:** ~44 minutes for all 342 guns with 5 browser restarts

### v2.1 Enhanced Scraper Results

**Files Created:**
- `data/output/afv_data/wwiitanks/all_guns_v2.json` (450KB - 342 guns with structured ammunition data)
- Per-country files: `{country}_guns_v2.json` (17 countries)

**Data Quality Improvements:**
- ✅ Properly structured ammunition arrays (average 2-4 types per gun)
- ✅ Penetration tables with 8 range entries per ammunition type
- ✅ Queryable specs (calibre, weight, muzzle velocity) per ammunition
- ✅ Normalized ammunition types (AP, AP40, HE, HEAT, UNKNOWN)
- ✅ 100% extraction success (342/342 guns)
- ✅ Full source provenance maintained

**Test Cases:**
- Complex gun (I=114): 4 ammunition types extracted with full penetration tables ✅
- Simple gun (I=360): Basic specs extracted correctly ✅

**Known Minor Issues (Non-blocking):**
- HE ammunition sometimes detected twice due to nested table structures
- Blast effects not fully captured for HE rounds
- Vehicle relationship count showing 0 (AFV ↔ Gun mappings not in main table)

## Pagination Fix Details

### Problem Identified (Initial Run)
- **Issue:** Only first 30 AFVs extracted per country
- **Root Cause:** Dropdown uses offset values (0, 30, 60, 90...), not page numbers (0, 1, 2...)
- **Impact:** Only 271/612 AFVs extracted initially (44%)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Detect pagination:** Check for `select#PAGER_PG1` dropdown element
2. **Extract offset values:** Read option values from dropdown (e.g., ['0', '30', '60', '90', '120', '150', '180'])
3. **Update both fields:** Set both `select#PAGER_PG1` dropdown AND hidden `input[name="PAGER_PG1"]` to correct offset value
4. **Submit form:** Trigger form submission via JavaScript to navigate to next page
5. **Wait for reload:** Wait for navigation complete and page stabilization before extracting next page

### Test Results
**Pagination test with Germany AFVs:**
- Expected: 204 vehicles
- Found: 204 vehicles (7 pages: 30+30+30+30+30+30+24)
- **Status: ✅ SUCCESS**

### Full Scrape Results
**All countries with pagination now complete:**
- Germany: 204/204 ✅ (was 30/204, +580% improvement)
- Britain: 125/125 ✅ (was 30/125, +317% improvement)
- USSR: 71/71 ✅ (was 30/71, +137% improvement)
- USA: 51/51 ✅ (was 30/51, +70% improvement)
- Canada: 38/38 ✅ (was 30/38, +27% improvement)
- Japan: 32/32 ✅ (was 30/32, +7% improvement)

**Total Improvement: +341 AFVs extracted (+125% increase)**
