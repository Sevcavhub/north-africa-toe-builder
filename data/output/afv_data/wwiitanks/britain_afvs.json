It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBren Gun(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe Bren gun was licenced from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.27 light machine gun which was designed and manufactured in Brno from 1935.\n\nIt fired the standard British .303 rifle round.\nManufactured1930 - 2004\nCalibre7.70mm\nLengthL/82\nRate of Fire500 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round - HPBT\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.01Kg 761M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.017Kg 783M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

based on the 4 x 4 drive Matador Artillery tractor chassis and was in use from 1943 to 1945.The vehicle was powered by Associated Equipment Company(AEC) 'AEC 197' diesel powerplant producing 158 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 40 mph with a range of about 250 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 20 mph and a range of about 112 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms and Bren Gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 114 mm of flat plate at 100 metres This vehicle was originally designed to take the Valentine MkII turret with the Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr gun, but the MkIII was uprated to use the Ordnance Q.F. 75mm gun for the close support role and had thicker armour.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront65mm@0°(65mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) SuperstructureFront30mm@45°(42mm)Side30mm@0°(30mm)Rear15mm@45°(21mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) \n        HullFront30mm@45°(42mm)Side30mm@0°(30mm)Rear15mm@45°(21mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 65 mm - Minimum 16 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\nNumber of Rounds 45\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBren Gun(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe Bren gun was licenced from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.27 light machine gun which was designed and manufactured in Brno from 1935.\n\nIt fired the standard British .303 rifle round.\nManufactured1930 - 2004\nCalibre7.70mm\nLengthL/82\nRate of Fire500 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round - HPBT\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.01Kg 761M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.017Kg 783M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Achilles.The vehicle was powered by General Motors 'General Motors 6046' diesel powerplant producing 375 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 32 mph with a range of about 322 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 20 mph and a range of about 186 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a Bren Gun.  and 1 large machine gun. consisting of 0.5 inch Browning Machine Gun M2 Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 17pdr which could penetrate 201 mm of flat plate at 100 metres .The Achilles was a British modification to the American M10 Tank Destroyer utilising the 17pdr gun instead of the American 3\" (76.2 mm) Gun M7, which improved the anti-tank capability significantly.\n\nThe original turret was open topped making it vulnerable to high explosives and grenades, and was manually rotated, so was slow to change directions. The Achilles had a modified roof of 20mm armour reducing the vulnerability of the M10.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront57mm@45°(81mm)Side25mm@75°(97mm)Rear25mm@0°(25mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) SuperstructureFront38mm@35°(46mm)Side19mm@52°(31mm)Rear19mm@52°(31mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront51mm@34°(62mm)Side25mm@0°(25mm)Rear25mm@0°(25mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 97 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 17pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nManufactured1942 - unknown\nCalibre76.20mm\nLengthL/55\nNumber of Rounds 50\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             17pdr MkI - MkIII\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 76.20mm 7.65Kg 950M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 130mm@915m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.11\n0.22\n0.44\n0.94\n1.5\n2.13\n2.85\n3.69\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n174\n161\n147\n129\n113\n97\n84\n71\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n201\n186\n170\n150\n131\n113\n97\n82\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n98\n88\n60\n34\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n             17pdr HE/Red\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.1Kg 550M/Sec 0.480Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.18\n0.37\n0.77\n1.63\n2.59\n3.68\n4.93\n6.37\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.18\n0.37\n0.77\n1.63\n2.59\n3.68\n4.93\n6.37\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n81\n44\n22\n8\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill2 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill5 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill13 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr1 mm\nAn explosion within 2 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 5 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 13 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 1 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.5 inch Browning Machine Gun M2(Machine Gun) \n            \nCalibre12.70mm\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 420\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             MG\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 12.70mm 0.04Kg 884M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 29mm @ 100mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.28\n0.67\n2.46\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n19\n15\n12\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n22\n18\n14\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBren Gun(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe Bren gun was licenced from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.27 light machine gun which was designed and manufactured in Brno from 1935.\n\nIt fired the standard British .303 rifle round.\nManufactured1930 - 2004\nCalibre7.70mm\nLengthL/82\nRate of Fire500 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round - HPBT\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.01Kg 761M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.017Kg 783M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 20 mph and a range of about 128 miles.It was armed with 1 large machine gun  consisting of 0.5 inch Browning Machine Gun M2 Its main armament consisted  of a 3 in Gun M7 L/53 which could penetrate 114 mm of flat plate at 800 metres .This was the American M10 as built, and supplied on a Lend Lease basis. \n\nThe turret was manually rotated and was open, so was not as fast to rotate as other models, and suffered from grenade and mortar attacks. Initially there was no provision for indirect fire, but this was resolved in later models and retrofitted.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront57mm@45°(81mm)Side25mm@75°(97mm)Rear25mm@0°(25mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) SuperstructureFront38mm@35°(46mm)Side19mm@52°(31mm)Rear19mm@52°(31mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront51mm@34°(62mm)Side25mm@0°(25mm)Rear25mm@0°(25mm)Topn/a Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 97 mm - Minimum 0 mm  Weapon Details\n\n3 in Gun M7 L/53 \n            \nCalibre76.20mm\nLengthL/53\nNumber of Rounds 50\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 76.20mm 7Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 84mm@2000m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.26\n0.53\n1.13\n1.8\n2.56\n3.42\n4.42\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n132\n122\n112\n98\n86\n74\n64\n53\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n153\n142\n130\n114\n100\n86\n74\n62\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n96\n77\n44\n25\n15\n\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.5 inch Browning Machine Gun M2(Machine Gun) \n            \nCalibre12.70mm\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 300\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             MG\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 12.70mm 0.04Kg 884M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 29mm @ 100mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.28\n0.67\n2.46\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n19\n15\n12\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n22\n18\n14\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n48",

Its cross country performance was poor providing a max speed of about 3 mph and a range of about 20 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a Bren Gun. This was a standard heavy british truck with a thick reinforced concrete structure built on top, various designs and truck bases were used so there were very few standard designs.\n\nIt was used as a mobile pill box for infantry to be protected from small arms fire, and was mostly used to defend airfields or by the home guard.\n\nThe walls were about 6 inches(152mm) thick and made from High Alumina Concrete that made them impervious to small arms fire and armour piercing bullets.      \n Armour Details(Concrete 1mm equivalent to 0.1200mm RHA)\n TurretFrontn/aSiden/aRearn/aTopn/a SuperstructureFront18mm@0°(18mm)Side18mm@15°(19mm)Rear18mm@15°(19mm)Top18mm@90°(18mm) \n        HullFront18mm@0°(18mm)Side18mm@15°(19mm)Rear18mm@15°(19mm)Top18mm@90°(18mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 19 mm - Minimum 18 mm  Weapon Details\n\nBren Gun(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe Bren gun was licenced from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.27 light machine gun which was designed and manufactured in Brno from 1935.\n\nIt fired the standard British .303 rifle round.\nManufactured1930 - 2004\nCalibre7.70mm\nLengthL/82\nRate of Fire500 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 200\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round - HPBT\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.01Kg 761M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Standard british .303 round\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.70mm 0.017Kg 783M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk. However the 2pdr manufacture was continued but was slowly replaced by the 6pdr from 1942.\nManufactured1936 - 1944\nCalibre40mm\nLengthL/50\nRate of Fire22 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP/T Mk I\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 40mm 1.08Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 53mm@455m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.58\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n64\n58\n51\n41\n33\n25\n19\n13\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n74\n67\n59\n48\n39\n30\n22\n16\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE/T Mk II after 1942\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 40mm 0.86Kg 792M/Sec 0.085Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill1 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill3 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill9 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr0 mm\nAn explosion within 1 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 9 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will not cause any significant armour damage.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was commonly called a A10.The vehicle was powered by Associated Equipment Company(AEC) 'AEC Type A179' petrol powerplant producing 150 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 74 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Cruiser tank MkII(A10) was a redesigned Mk I(A9) which had upgraded armour and the two auxilliary turrets removed this version also had a hull mounted machine gun.\n\nThe turret had power traverse with a 2pdr A/T gun. The vehicle had the two auxilliary machine gun from the Mk I removed , and replaced by one hull mounted machine gun. The armour was upgraded hence the speed reduction over the A9.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront30mm@20°(32mm)Side26mm@20°(28mm)Rear30mm@20°(32mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) SuperstructureFront22mm@45°(31mm)Side22mm@0°(22mm)Rear12mm@0°(12mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) \n        HullFront22mm@30°(25mm)Side22mm@0°(22mm)Rear12mm@0°(12mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 32 mm - Minimum 7 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939. The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk. However the 2pdr manufacture was continued but was slowly replaced by the 6pdr from 1942.\nManufactured1936 - 1944\nCalibre40mm\nLengthL/50\nRate of Fire22 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP/T Mk I\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 40mm 1.08Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 53mm@455m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.58\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n64\n58\n51\n41\n33\n25\n19\n13\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n74\n67\n59\n48\n39\n30\n22\n16\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE/T Mk II after 1942\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 40mm 0.86Kg 792M/Sec 0.085Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill1 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill3 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill9 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr0 mm\nAn explosion within 1 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 9 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will not cause any significant armour damage.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 2000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a A10.The vehicle was powered by Associated Equipment Company(AEC) 'AEC Type A179' petrol powerplant producing 150 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 3.7inch CS Howitzer which could penetrate 38 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Mk II C.S. close support version was the Mk I but with a 3.7 inch howitzer.  The vehicle had the two auxilliary machine gun from the Mk I removed , and replaced by one hull mounted machine gun. The armour was upgraded hence the speed reduction.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront30mm@20°(32mm)Side26mm@20°(28mm)Rear30mm@20°(32mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) SuperstructureFront22mm@45°(31mm)Side22mm@0°(22mm)Rear12mm@0°(12mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) \n        HullFront22mm@30°(25mm)Side22mm@0°(22mm)Rear12mm@0°(12mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 32 mm - Minimum 7 mm  Weapon Details\n\n\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \nOrdnance Q.F. 3.7inch CS Howitzer(Field Gun) \n            \nManufacturedunknown - 1941\nCalibre94mm\nLengthL/15\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             3.7inch CS HE\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 94mm 9Kg 189M/Sec ≈1.35Kg explosive\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.54\n1.08\n2.21\n4.63\n7.28\n10.21\n13.44\n17.06\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.54\n1.08\n2.21\n4.63\n7.28\n10.21\n13.44\n17.06\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n57\n8\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill4 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill8 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill22 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr4 mm\nAn explosion within 4 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 8 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 22 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 4 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 2000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 3750\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 3750\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was commonly called a Covenanter I.The vehicle was powered by Meadows 'Flat-12' petrol powerplant producing 300 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 31 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 59 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Covenanter tank was a redesigned A13 by LMSR as a heavy cruiser tank that could rapidly move and provide good A/T performance. It was not used operationally due to serious overheating issues with the front mounted engine.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront40mm@20°(43mm)Side16mm@20°(17mm)Rear16mm@20°(17mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) SuperstructureFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@0°(14mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) \n        HullFront40mm@30°(46mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@0°(14mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 57 mm - Minimum 4 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939. The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk.

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was commonly called a Covenanter II.The vehicle was powered by Meadows 'Flat-12' petrol powerplant producing 300 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 31 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 48 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The vehicle was not used operationally due to serious overheating of the front mounted engine. The Covenanter II had improved cooling over the Covenanter I.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront40mm@20°(43mm)Side16mm@20°(17mm)Rear16mm@20°(17mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) SuperstructureFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@0°(14mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) \n        HullFront40mm@30°(46mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@0°(14mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 57 mm - Minimum 4 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 3750\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Covenanter III.The vehicle was powered by Meadows 'Flat-12' petrol powerplant producing 300 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 31 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 67 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The vehicle was not used operationally due to serious overheating of the front mounted engine.

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Covenanter IV.The vehicle was powered by Meadows 'Flat-12' petrol powerplant producing 300 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 31 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 74 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The vehicle was not used operationally due to serious overheating of the front mounted engine. The Covenanter IV had improved cooling over the Covenanter III but again this was still not good enough.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront40mm@20°(43mm)Side16mm@20°(17mm)Rear16mm@20°(17mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) SuperstructureFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@0°(14mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) \n        HullFront40mm@30°(46mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@0°(14mm)Top4mm@90°(4mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 57 mm - Minimum 4 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939. The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk. However the 2pdr manufacture was continued but was slowly replaced by the 6pdr from 1942.\nManufactured1936 - 1944\nCalibre40mm\nLengthL/50\nRate of Fire22 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP/T Mk I\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 40mm 1.08Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 53mm@455m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.58\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n64\n58\n51\n41\n33\n25\n19\n13\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n74\n67\n59\n48\n39\n30\n22\n16\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE/T Mk II after 1942\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 40mm 0.86Kg 792M/Sec 0.085Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill1 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill3 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill9 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr0 mm\nAn explosion within 1 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 9 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will not cause any significant armour damage.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was commonly called a Crusader I.The vehicle was powered by Nuffield 'Liberty' petrol powerplant producing 340 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 28 mph with a range of about 124 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 15 mph and a range of about 49 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 59 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Crusader tank was derived from the same A13 basis as the Covenanter, the Crusader was less inclined to overheating than the Covenanter, but still suffered from a great deal of breakdowns and drive train issues.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront49mm@7°(49mm)Side24mm@45°(34mm)Rear30mm@32°(35mm)Top12mm@90°(12mm) SuperstructureFront20mm@60°(40mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@11°(14mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) \n        HullFront20mm@45°(28mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@11°(14mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 49 mm - Minimum 7 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939. The majority of the British guns were captured by the Germans at Dunkirk. However the 2pdr manufacture was continued but was slowly replaced by the 6pdr from 1942.\nManufactured1936 - 1944\nCalibre40mm\nLengthL/50\nRate of Fire22 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 130\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP/T Mk I\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 40mm 1.08Kg 792M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 53mm@455m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.58\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n64\n58\n51\n41\n33\n25\n19\n13\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n74\n67\n59\n48\n39\n30\n22\n16\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE/T Mk II after 1942\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 40mm 0.86Kg 792M/Sec 0.085Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.27\n0.56\n1.26\n2.17\n3.37\n5.06\n7.59\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n93\n60\n25\n6\n2\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill1 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill3 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill9 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr0 mm\nAn explosion within 1 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 9 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will not cause any significant armour damage.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 4500\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Crusader I C.S..The vehicle was powered by Nuffield 'Liberty' petrol powerplant producing 340 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 28 mph with a range of about 124 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 15 mph and a range of about 49 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 3inch Howitzer which could penetrate 96 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Crusader tank was derived from the same A13 basis as the Covenanter, the Crusader was less inclined to overheating than the Covenanter, but still suffered from a great deal of breakdowns and drive train issues.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront49mm@7°(49mm)Side24mm@45°(34mm)Rear30mm@32°(35mm)Top12mm@90°(12mm) SuperstructureFront20mm@60°(40mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@11°(14mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) \n        HullFront20mm@45°(28mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear14mm@11°(14mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 49 mm - Minimum 7 mm  Weapon Details\n\n\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \nOrdnance Q.F. 3inch Howitzer(Field Gun) \n            \nManufacturedunknown - 1945\nCalibre76.20mm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             3 inch howitzer AP\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.3Kg 650M/Sec 0.600Kg explosive\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.77\n4.17\n7.61\n12.96\n22.39\n43.45\n132.43\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.32\n0.65\n1.38\n2.19\n3.12\n4.17\n5.39\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n90\n60\n25\n15\n6\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill15 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr1 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 15 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 1 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 4500\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Crusader II.The vehicle was powered by Nuffield 'Liberty' petrol powerplant producing 340 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 28 mph with a range of about 125 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 15 mph and a range of about 50 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 67 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Crusader tank was derived from the same A13 basis as the Covenanter, the Crusader was less inclined to overheating than the Covenanter, but still suffered from a great deal of breakdowns and drive train issues.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront49mm@7°(49mm)Side24mm@45°(34mm)Rear30mm@32°(35mm)Top12mm@90°(12mm) SuperstructureFront30mm@38°(38mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear28mm@11°(29mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) \n        HullFront20mm@60°(40mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear28mm@11°(29mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 49 mm - Minimum 7 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Crusader III C.S..The vehicle was powered by Nuffield 'Liberty' petrol powerplant producing 340 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 28 mph with a range of about 124 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 15 mph and a range of about 49 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 3inch Howitzer which could penetrate 113 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Crusader tank was derived from the same A13 basis as the Covenanter, the Crusader was less inclined to overheating than the Covenanter, but still suffered from a great deal of breakdowns and drive train issues, this was the Close Support version with the 3inch gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront49mm@7°(49mm)Side24mm@45°(34mm)Rear30mm@32°(35mm)Top12mm@90°(12mm) SuperstructureFront30mm@38°(38mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear28mm@11°(29mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) \n        HullFront20mm@60°(40mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear28mm@11°(29mm)Top7mm@90°(7mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 49 mm - Minimum 7 mm  Weapon Details\n\n\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \nOrdnance Q.F. 3inch Howitzer(Field Gun) \n            \nManufacturedunknown - 1945\nCalibre76.20mm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             3 inch howitzer AP\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.3Kg 650M/Sec 0.600Kg explosive\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.77\n4.17\n7.61\n12.96\n22.39\n43.45\n132.43\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.32\n0.65\n1.38\n2.19\n3.12\n4.17\n5.39\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n90\n60\n25\n15\n6\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill15 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr1 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 15 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 1 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 4500\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Centaur III.The vehicle was powered by Nuffield 'Liberty'  powerplant producing 395 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 27 mph with a range of about 165 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 14 mph and a range of about 66 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 106 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Centaur was the Leyland version of the Cavalier and were mainly used for training or special purpose roles.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 2000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Challenger A30.The vehicle was powered by Rolls Royce 'Meteor V-12' petrol powerplant producing 600 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 32 mph with a range of about 120 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 15 mph and a range of about 48 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 17pdr which could penetrate 186 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Challenger tank was designed as a heavy cruiser tank that could rapidly move and provide good A/T performance, in appearance it looked like the Cavalier.The vehicle had a rear Rolls Royce Meteor engine producing 600hp driving the tracks, towards the main front idler over the 6 large road wheels, round the idler and back under the roadwheels in the standard Christie style.The Challenger was a redesigned Cromwell designed to take the 17pdr AT gun, however too many changes were needed and only a few vehicles saw service.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 17pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nManufactured1942 - unknown\nCalibre76.20mm\nLengthL/55\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             17pdr MkI - MkIII\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 76.20mm 7.65Kg 950M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 130mm@915m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.11\n0.22\n0.44\n0.94\n1.5\n2.13\n2.85\n3.69\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n174\n161\n147\n129\n113\n97\n84\n71\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n201\n186\n170\n150\n131\n113\n97\n82\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n98\n88\n60\n34\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n             17pdr HE/Red\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.1Kg 550M/Sec 0.480Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.18\n0.37\n0.77\n1.63\n2.59\n3.68\n4.93\n6.37\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.18\n0.37\n0.77\n1.63\n2.59\n3.68\n4.93\n6.37\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n81\n44\n22\n8\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill2 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill5 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill13 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr1 mm\nAn explosion within 2 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 5 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 13 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 1 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun) \n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Cromwell II Mk I.The vehicle was powered by Rolls Royce 'Meteor  V12' petrol powerplant producing 600 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 40 mph with a range of about 166 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 22 mph and a range of about 66 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 114 mm of flat plate at 100 metres This was a development of the Cromwell that utilised a Vauxhall cast turret that was similar to the Churchill turret. This model was only a development version and never used or produced in volume.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\nNumber of Rounds 64\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 4950\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Cromwell IV/V.The vehicle was powered by Rolls Royce 'Meteor  V12' petrol powerplant producing 600 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 40 mph with a range of about 166 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 22 mph and a range of about 66 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 85 mm of flat plate at 800 metres These models had the ROQF 75mm bored out 6pdr gun which had slightly less penetration than the 6pdr but could fire High Explosive.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\nNumber of Rounds 64\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 4950\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Cromwell VI.The vehicle was powered by Rolls Royce 'Meteor  V12' petrol powerplant producing 600 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 40 mph with a range of about 166 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 22 mph and a range of about 66 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a BESA Machine Gun 7.92mm. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 95mm Howitzer which could penetrate 75 mm of flat plate at 100 metres This was the close support machine that could fire High Explosive from the 95mm Howitzer, but its main role was to fire Smoke Shells to hide the movement of the main tank force.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side63mm@0°(63mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top20mm@81°(20mm) SuperstructureFront63mm@0°(63mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront57mm@0°(57mm)Side32mm@0°(32mm)Rear32mm@0°(32mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 76 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 95mm Howitzer(Field Gun) \n            \nManufacturedunknown - 1945\nCalibre95mm\nNumber of Rounds 64\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             95mm APHE\n             (APHE Armor Piercing High Explosive)\n             \n 95mm 6.72Kg 502M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.2\n0.41\n0.83\n1.74\n2.74\n3.83\n5.05\n6.4\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n64\n60\n56\n51\n45\n41\n37\n32\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n75\n70\n65\n59\n53\n48\n43\n38\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n77\n39\n22\n6\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             95mm HE\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 95mm 11.34Kg 320M/Sec ≈1.701Kg explosive\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.32\n0.64\n1.3\n2.73\n4.29\n6.01\n7.92\n10.04\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.32\n0.64\n1.3\n2.73\n4.29\n6.01\n7.92\n10.04\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n93\n39\n15\n3\n2\n0\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill4 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill8 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill22 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr5 mm\nAn explosion within 4 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 8 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 22 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 5 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun) \n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\nNumber of Rounds 64\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 4950\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Comet A34.The vehicle was powered by Rolls Royce 'Meteor  V12' petrol powerplant producing 600 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 29 mph with a range of about 123 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 15 mph and a range of about 49 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns which were BESA Machine Gun 7.92mms. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 77mm 3inch which could penetrate 167 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Comet was a redesigned Cromwell which could to take the full 17pdr AT gun, this failed so a cut down 17pdr - the 77mm was fitted. The Cromwell chassis had to be extended and widened to take the new turret.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront102mm@0°(102mm)Side64mm@0°(64mm)Rear57mm@0°(57mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront76mm@0°(76mm)Side29mm@0°(29mm)Rear25mm@0°(25mm)Top14mm@90°(14mm) \n        HullFront64mm@0°(64mm)Side14mm@0°(14mm)Rear25mm@0°(25mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 102 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 77mm 3inch(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a slightly shortened 17pdr which was designed for Tank use which appeared to be more accurate at longer ranges.\nManufacturedunknown - 1945\nCalibre76.20mm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 76.20mm 7.65Kg 792M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.13\n0.26\n0.53\n1.13\n1.8\n2.56\n3.42\n4.42\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n144\n134\n122\n108\n94\n81\n70\n58\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n167\n155\n142\n125\n109\n94\n81\n68\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n96\n77\n44\n25\n15\n\n\n Weapon Details\n\nBESA Machine Gun 7.92mm(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nHistory\nDeveloped by BSA from the Czechoslovak ZB vz.53 heavy machine gun which used the German 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition. It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets.

It was mostly used as the main armament of the Light Tank Mk VIC and Armoured cars such as the Humber Mk I to Mk III.\n\nThis 7.92mm gun was used in the armoured divisions as their supply lines were separated from the infantry who used .303 bullets. Once the British started capturing German ammunition this could be immediately used in these tank machine guns.\nManufactured1939 - 1966\nCalibre7.92mm\nLengthL/93\nRate of Fire450 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 2000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (AP Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.011Kg 785M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 11mm @ 1000mtr/0° \n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.37\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n10\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n12\n10\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n             Cartridge SA, 7.92\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.92mm 0.012Kg 785M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Matilda  II A12.The vehicle was powered by AEC '174HP' diesel powerplant producing 174 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 15 mph with a range of about 101 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 62 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 74 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Matilda II was a complete new design to replace the Matilda I Infantry tank, which had been superceeded by advances in tank designs.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@11°(76mm)Side75mm@0°(75mm)Rear75mm@0°(75mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront48mm@67°(123mm)Side70mm@30°(81mm)Rear55mm@25°(61mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront78mm@10°(79mm)Side65mm@0°(65mm)Rear55mm@25°(61mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 123 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Matilda  IV.The vehicle was powered by Leyland 'Diesel 190HP' diesel powerplant producing 190 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 15 mph with a range of about 101 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 62 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 59 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Matilda IV was a complete new design to replace the Matilda I Infantry tank, which had been superceeded by advances in tank designs.\n\nThis version had a few minor improvements over the Matilda III.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@11°(76mm)Side75mm@0°(75mm)Rear75mm@0°(75mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront48mm@67°(123mm)Side70mm@30°(81mm)Rear55mm@25°(61mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront78mm@10°(79mm)Side65mm@0°(65mm)Rear55mm@25°(61mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 123 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Matilda  V.The vehicle was powered by Leyland 'Diesel 190HP' diesel powerplant producing 190 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 15 mph with a range of about 101 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 62 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 67 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Matilda V was a complete new design to replace the Matilda I Infantry tank, which had been superceeded by advances in tank designs.\n\nThis version had a few minor improvements over the Matilda IV.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@11°(76mm)Side75mm@0°(75mm)Rear75mm@0°(75mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront48mm@67°(123mm)Side70mm@30°(81mm)Rear55mm@25°(61mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) \n        HullFront78mm@10°(79mm)Side65mm@0°(65mm)Rear55mm@25°(61mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 123 mm - Minimum 20 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Valentine II.The vehicle was powered by AEC 'A190' diesel powerplant producing 131 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 15 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 67 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Infantry tank MkIII the Valentine was a redesigned A10 to provide an infantry support tank which could move slowly with the infantry to provide AT and machine gun support.\n\nThe armour was good for this size of vehicle. The Valentine II had sand shields on the tracks after experience in North Africa.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront65mm@0°(65mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) SuperstructureFront30mm@68°(80mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) \n        HullFront60mm@21°(64mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 80 mm - Minimum 10 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Valentine V.The vehicle was powered by GMC '6004' diesel powerplant producing 131 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 15 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 74 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Infantry tank MkIII the Valentine was a redesigned A10 to provide an infantry support tank which could move slowly with the infantry to provide AT and machine gun support.\n\nThe armour was good for this size of vehicle. The Valentine V had a larger turret to accomodate a extra crew member, and had the GMC engine.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront65mm@0°(65mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) SuperstructureFront30mm@68°(80mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) \n        HullFront60mm@21°(64mm)Side60mm@0°(60mm)Rear60mm@0°(60mm)Top10mm@90°(10mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 80 mm - Minimum 10 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Churchill  1 - I.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 3inch Howitzer which could penetrate 105 mm of flat plate at 200 metres Its main armament consisted  and an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 67 mm of flat plate at 200 metres.The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The Mk I had a hull mounted 3inch howitzer to the right of the driver .      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\n\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \nOrdnance Q.F. 3inch Howitzer(Field Gun) \n            \nManufacturedunknown - 1945\nCalibre76.20mm\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             3 inch howitzer AP\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.3Kg 650M/Sec 0.600Kg explosive\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.77\n4.17\n7.61\n12.96\n22.39\n43.45\n132.43\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.32\n0.65\n1.38\n2.19\n3.12\n4.17\n5.39\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n90\n60\n25\n15\n6\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill15 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr1 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 15 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 1 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Churchill  2 - II.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 2pdr which could penetrate 74 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The Mk II had a hull mounted machine gun to the right of the driver to replace the 3inch howitzer in the Mk I.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 2pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nUsed both as an Anti Tank gun and as a Tank gun the 2pdr was first used in Belgium in 1939.

It was commonly called a Churchill  3 - III.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 6pdr 7cwt MKI-III which could penetrate 96 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew this version was armed with the 6pdr gun.\n\nThe vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications\n.\nThe Mk II had a hull mounted machine gun to the right of the driver to replace the 3inch howitzer in the Mk I.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 6pdr 7cwt MKI-III(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThe 6pdr Mk II—differed from the pre-production Mk I in having a shorter L/43 barrel, because of shortage of suitable lathes.

The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkIV had a cast turret which held the 6pdr gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm",

It was commonly called a Churchill  7 - VI.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkVI was upgraded to use the 75mm gun replacing the 6pdr.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm",

It was commonly called a Churchill  8 - VIII.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkVII this was a major redesign with a new turret firing the 75mm and redesigned hull and massively thicker armour than the MkVI.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront88mm@0°(88mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear89mm@0°(89mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) SuperstructureFront88mm@20°(94mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) \n        HullFront38mm@70°(111mm)Side76mm@0°(76mm)Rear64mm@0°(64mm)Top16mm@90°(16mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 111 mm - Minimum 16 mm",

It was commonly called a Churchill  9 - IX.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 114 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkIX classified were reworked older vehicles usually MkIII with additional applique armour to bring them up to MkVII levels of armour, and armed with the 75mm gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell.

It was commonly called a Churchill 10 - X.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 96 mm of flat plate at 400 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkX classified were reworked older vehicles usually MkIV with additional applique armour to bring them up to MkVII levels of armour, and armed with the 75mm gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell.

It was commonly called a Churchill 11 - XI.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 85 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The MkXI classified were reworked older vehicles usually MkVI with additional applique armour to bring them up to MkVII levels of armour, and armed with the 75mm gun.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell.

It was commonly called a Churchill Crocodile.The vehicle was powered by Bedford '350HP' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 16 mph with a range of about 90 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was adequate providing a max speed of about 8 mph and a range of about 36 miles.It was armed with 2 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 85 mm of flat plate at 800 metres The Churchill Infantry tank was designed as a tank that could cope with movement through heavily shelled areas, and provide adequate protection for the crew.The vehicle was layed out in a similar way to the tanks from the First World War with the rear Bedford 350hp engine driving the tracks, to the front via small idlers to the fron main idler, then via 11small sprung road wheels. The first vehicles had many mechanical faults and hence many subsequent modifications.The Crocodile was a modified Churchill with a flame projector mounted in the normal hull machine gun position, its range was up to 120 yds but normally reached 80yds. The 400 gallons of fuel was carried in an armoured trailer behind the tank that could be quickly released if it caught fire, the pressure for the flame was obtained from 5 nitrogen bottles in the trailer.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront152mm@0°(152mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear95mm@0°(95mm)Top20mm@90°(20mm) SuperstructureFront152mm@20°(162mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront50mm@70°(146mm)Side95mm@0°(95mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 162 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell. It was created by boring out the British 57mm 6pdr to take the American 75mm AP/HE shells, which reduced the Anti Tank performance but provided HE support.\nManufactured1943 - 1945\nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/32\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP M72 U.S.\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.58Kg 618M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.71\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n98\n91\n83\n73\n64\n55\n46\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n114\n106\n96\n85\n74\n64\n54\n45\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.",

It was commonly called a Grant.The vehicle was powered by Wright 'Continental R975 EC2' petrol powerplant producing 340 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 21 mph with a range of about 120 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 11 mph and a range of about 48 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 75mm which could penetrate 106 mm of flat plate at 200 metres Its main armament consisted  and an Ordnance Q.F. 37mm Mk 1 which could penetrate 48 mm of flat plate at 200 metres.The Medium tank M3 Grant was was an American M3 Lee tank modified by replacing the original turret by a lower profile one with a large overhang at the rear to take radios, the Grant was the British version.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront51mm@47°(75mm)Side51mm@5°(51mm)Rear51mm@5°(51mm)Top22mm@90°(22mm) SuperstructureFront51mm@45°(72mm)Side38mm@0°(38mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) \n        HullFront45mm@45°(64mm)Side38mm@0°(38mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top13mm@87°(13mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 75 mm - Minimum 13 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 75mm(Tank Gun) \n            \nHistory\nThis was a temporary fix to the problem of 6pdr guns not having a powerful enough HE shell.

This calculation\n   originally came from a pre-war Krupp calculation which has been modified, and seems to fit the actual test results.       \n       \n        \n         \n     \n\t   \n\t   © WWIITanks 1980-2025\n     If you have any information, or comments on our site,\n      please E-Mail Simon at\n     wwiitanks@villagenet.co.uk\n     Page Last Updated: 2025-01-01",

It was commonly called a Sherman II.The vehicle was powered by Continental 'R957C1' petrol powerplant producing 350 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 24 mph with a range of about 120 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 48 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4s. Its main armament consisted  of a 75mm Gun M3 L/40 which could penetrate 102 mm of flat plate at 200 metres The Sherman II M4A1 was a similar shape to the M4 but had a curved cast hull which provided less flat surfaces for AT hits, this was mostly noticable at the top of the hull next to the turret.\n\nThe cast turret carrying the gyro stabilised 75mm Gun M3 was the same as that of the Sherman I.\n\nIt was driven by a Continental 350HP air cooled engine with the drive sprocket at the front, the track went under 3 double bogie wheels onto the idler, then back over 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@0°(75mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront50mm@45°(71mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 75 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\n75mm Gun M3 L/40 \n            \nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/40\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.32Kg 619M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 70mm@500m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.7\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n95\n88\n79\n70\n61\n52\n45\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n110\n102\n92\n81\n71\n61\n52\n44\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range 5000 Mtr\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.85\n4.36\n8\n13.72\n24.01\n48.06\n168.4\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Sherman V.The vehicle was powered by Chrysler 'A57' petrol powerplant producing 370 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 25 mph with a range of about 100 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 17 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4s. Its main armament consisted  of a 75mm Gun M3 L/40 which could penetrate 110 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Sherman V M4A4 was a similar shape to the M4 but had a welded hull and was powered by 5 Chrysler car engines geared together producing 425HP.\n\nThe cast turret carrying the gyro stabilised 75mm Gun M3 was the same as that of the Sherman I.\nAs with the earlier Sherman I the drive sprocket was at the front, the track went under 3 double bogie wheels onto the idler, then back over 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@0°(75mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront50mm@45°(71mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 75 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\n75mm Gun M3 L/40 \n            \nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/40\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.32Kg 619M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 70mm@500m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.7\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n95\n88\n79\n70\n61\n52\n45\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n110\n102\n92\n81\n71\n61\n52\n44\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range 5000 Mtr\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.85\n4.36\n8\n13.72\n24.01\n48.06\n168.4\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Sherman.The vehicle was powered by Caterpillar 'RD1820' petrol powerplant producing 450 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 30 mph with a range of about 120 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 18 mph and a range of about 48 miles.It was armed with 3 light machine guns which were 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4s. Its main armament consisted  of a 75mm Gun M3 L/40 which could penetrate 110 mm of flat plate at 100 metres The Sherman V M4A4 was a similar shape to the M4 but had a lengthened welded hull and was powered by the Ordnance RD-1820 engine producing 497HP.\n\nThe cast turret carrying the gyro stabilised 75mm Gun M3 was the same as that of the Sherman I.\nAs with the earlier Sherman I the drive sprocket was at the front, the track went under 3 double bogie wheels onto the idler, then back over 3 return rollers.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront75mm@0°(75mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear50mm@0°(50mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront50mm@45°(71mm)Side50mm@0°(50mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 75 mm - Minimum 19 mm  Weapon Details\n\n75mm Gun M3 L/40 \n            \nCalibre75mm\nLengthL/40\nNumber of Rounds 100\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             AP\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 75mm 6.32Kg 619M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 70mm@500m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.45\n2.31\n3.29\n4.41\n5.7\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n95\n88\n79\n70\n61\n52\n45\n38\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n110\n102\n92\n81\n71\n61\n52\n44\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n54\n25\n15\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n             HE M48\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 75mm 6.76Kg 625M/Sec 0.680Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range 5000 Mtr\n\nRange(Mtr)10002000300040005000600070008000\nFlight Time(Secs)\n1.85\n4.36\n8\n13.72\n24.01\n48.06\n168.4\n\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.16\n0.33\n0.68\n1.43\n2.29\n3.25\n4.36\n5.65\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n88\n57\n25\n15\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill3 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill6 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill16 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr2 mm\nAn explosion within 3 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 6 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 16 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 2 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",

It was commonly called a Firefly VC.The vehicle was powered by Continental 'Radial' petrol powerplant producing 430 HP which could drive the vehicle on roads at up to 24 mph with a range of about 101 miles before refuelling. Its cross country performance was good providing a max speed of about 13 mph and a range of about 40 miles.It was armed with 1 light machine gun , a 0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4.  and 1 large machine gun. Its main armament consisted  of an Ordnance Q.F. 17pdr which could penetrate 186 mm of flat plate at 200 metres .The Sherman II M4A1 Firefly was a similar shape to the M4 but had a curved cast hull which provided less flat surfaces for AT hits, this was mostly noticable at the top of the hull next to the turret.\n\nThe cast turret was modified to take the British 17pdr and a box added to the rear of the turret due to the length of the 17pdr.      \n Armour Details\n TurretFront65mm@0°(65mm)Side65mm@0°(65mm)Rear65mm@0°(65mm)Top25mm@90°(25mm) SuperstructureFront51mm@45°(72mm)Side38mm@0°(38mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top19mm@90°(19mm) \n        HullFront40mm@45°(57mm)Side40mm@0°(40mm)Rear38mm@0°(38mm)Top14mm@90°(14mm) Armour (x)mm @ (y)° (Effective mm @ 0°)Effective Armour - Maximum 72 mm - Minimum 14 mm  Weapon Details\n\nOrdnance Q.F. 17pdr(Anti Tank Gun) \n            \nManufactured1942 - unknown\nCalibre76.20mm\nLengthL/55\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             17pdr MkI - MkIII\n             (AP Armor Piercing)\n             \n 76.20mm 7.65Kg 950M/Sec \n Quoted Penetration 130mm@915m\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.11\n0.22\n0.44\n0.94\n1.5\n2.13\n2.85\n3.69\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n174\n161\n147\n129\n113\n97\n84\n71\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n201\n186\n170\n150\n131\n113\n97\n82\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n98\n88\n60\n34\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n             17pdr HE/Red\n             (HE High Explosive)\n             \n 76.20mm 6.1Kg 550M/Sec 0.480Kg explosive\n\n Maximum Range not shown as gun elevation is limited\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.18\n0.37\n0.77\n1.63\n2.59\n3.68\n4.93\n6.37\n\n\n Direct Fire\n\nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.18\n0.37\n0.77\n1.63\n2.59\n3.68\n4.93\n6.37\nHit Probability(%)\n98\n98\n98\n81\n44\n22\n8\n3\n\n Blast/Fragmentation Effects\n\nBurst radius Infantry in open 99% kill2 mtr\n          Burst radius Infantry in open 66% kill5 mtr\nBurst radius Infantry in open 33% kill13 mtr \n           Armour Penetration inc roof at 1 mtr1 mm\nAn explosion within 2 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 99% casualties - lethal.\nAn explosion within 5 mtr of infantry in the open will cause > 66% casualties and could damage some AFV's.\nAn explosion within 13 mtr of infantry in the open will cause 33% casualties.\nThe blast effect of this shell exploding within 1 mtr of an armoured vehicle will penetrate 1 mm of the tank armour including the roof.\n\n Weapon Details\n\n0.3 inch Browning Machine Gun M1919A4(Machine Gun)  x 2\n            \nManufacturerBrowning\nManufactured1919 - 1945\nCalibre7.60mm\nLengthL/80\nRate of Fire480 rpm\nNumber of Rounds 6000\n\n Ammunition Details\n\n Name/Id\n Calibre Weight MVelocity\n Explosive Content\n\n \n             .30-06 Springfield\n             (BALL Standard Small Arms)\n             \n 7.62mm 0.012Kg 820M/Sec \nRange(Mtr)1002004008001200160020002400\nFlight Time(Secs)\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@30°)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenetration(mm@0°)\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit Probability(%)\n98",
