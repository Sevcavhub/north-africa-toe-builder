## Greek Squadron in Exile

### Formation and Background

No. 335 Squadron was formed on **10 October 1941** at Aqir airfield in Palestine, originally intended to be designated as No. 361 Squadron, Royal Hellenic Air Force, but ultimately becoming No. 335 Squadron under RAF operational control. The squadron drew its personnel from two primary sources:

**Greek Officers from Iraq Training Program**:
- Greek Air Force officers sent to Iraq in 1940 for training by British instructors
- Already familiar with RAF tactics, procedures, and aircraft types
- Provided core of experienced personnel for new squadron

**Pilots Who Escaped Greece**:
- Greek pilots who fled Greece during or after the German invasion (April 1941)
- Traveled through Turkey, Syria, or by sea to reach British-controlled territory
- Brought combat experience from Greek-Italian War (October 1940 - April 1941)

The squadron became fully operational on **12 February 1942** at El Daba, Egypt, and immediately began operations over the Western Desert. By Q4 1942, the squadron had accumulated eight months of combat experience, operating continuously in fighter, bomber escort, and ground attack roles.

### Greek National Identity

Unlike other multinational squadrons in the Desert Air Force that mixed British Commonwealth personnel, No. 335 Squadron maintained a distinctly Greek identity:

**Personnel Composition**:
- All pilots were Greek nationals (Hellenic Air Force officers)
- Most ground officers were Greek (engineering, armament, adjutant)
- Ground crew likely included both Greek personnel and RAF support staff
- Squadron maintained Greek military traditions and customs

**National Symbolism**:
- Squadron operations carried symbolic importance for Greek government-in-exile
- 28 October operations deliberately scheduled for Greek national anniversaries
- Squadron represented continuing Greek resistance against Axis occupation
- High morale value for Greek expatriate community in Egypt

### Squadron Leader Ioannis Kellas

Squadron Leader Ioannis Kellas (Greek: Ιωάννης Κέλλας, 1908-1966) commanded No. 335 Squadron during the critical Q4 1942 period, including the Second Battle of El Alamein.

**Background and Experience**:
- Former commander of 21st Pursuit Squadron during Greek-Italian War (1940-1941)
- Participated in combat operations against Italian Regia Aeronautica
- Escaped to North Africa following German invasion (April 1941)
- Assumed command of 335 Squadron by mid-1942

**Leadership Characteristics**:
- Emphasized tactical coordination with other Desert Air Force units
- Maintained Greek military discipline and traditions
- Successfully integrated squadron into RAF operational structure
- Led squadron through transition from ground attack to shipping protection roles

**Notable Operations**:
- Commanded squadron during Second Battle of El Alamein (October-November 1942)
- Personally led 28 October 1942 attack on Italian XX Corps headquarters
- Oversaw squadron's frequent base relocations during pursuit phase
- Managed transition to shipping protection mission (November 1942)

### Parent Formation: No. 7 (SAAF) Wing

By late October 1942 (27 October 1942 specifically documented), No. 335 Squadron was assigned to **No. 7 (SAAF) Wing**, a South African Air Force wing within the Desert Air Force structure. This organizational placement reflected:

**Operational Integration**:
- Coordination with South African fighter squadrons
- Shared wing headquarters for tactical planning
- Combined operations during major offensives
- Mutual support for maintenance and logistics

**Chain of Command (27 October 1942)**:
- No. 335 (Hellenic) Squadron RAF
- ↓
- No. 7 (SAAF) Wing
- ↓
- No. 212 Group
- ↓
- AHQ Western Desert (Air Headquarters Western Desert)
- ↓
- Middle East Command

This command structure placed Greek squadron pilots under RAF operational control while maintaining Greek squadron identity and Greek officer leadership at squadron level.

### Flight Organization

No. 335 Squadron followed standard RAF fighter squadron organization:

**A Flight**:
- Flight Commander: [Name not found in available sources]
- Approximately 8 aircraft on establishment
- 10 pilots (including commander)

**B Flight**:
- Flight Commander: [Name not found in available sources]
- Approximately 8 aircraft on establishment
- 10 pilots (including commander)

This two-flight structure provided operational flexibility for simultaneous missions, combat air patrol rotations, or full squadron operations as tactical requirements demanded.

## Operational Bases (October-December 1942)

No. 335 Squadron relocated four times during Q4 1942, reflecting the rapid advance of Allied forces following the Second Battle of El Alamein. This mobility was characteristic of Desert Air Force operations, with squadrons moving forward to maintain air coverage of advancing ground forces.

### LG.85 (October 1942)

**Location**: Landing Ground 85, Western Desert, Egypt
**Period**: October 1942 (early part of month)

LG.85 served as the squadron's base during the build-up to Operation Lightfoot (Second Battle of El Alamein). The "LG" designation referred to "Landing Ground" - the temporary airfields constructed throughout the Western Desert to support mobile air operations.

**Airfield Characteristics**:
- Dirt/sand runway surface (typical of desert LGs)
- Minimal fixed facilities (tents, fuel dumps, ammunition storage)
- Mobile operations (squadron could relocate on short notice)
- Shared with other squadrons (typically 2-4 squadrons per LG)

### LG.37 (October-November 1942)

**Location**: Landing Ground 37, Western Desert, Egypt/Libya border region
**Period**: Late October - early November 1942

LG.37 became the squadron's base during the critical opening phases of the El Alamein battle and early pursuit operations. This forward position allowed the squadron to:
- Maintain shorter flight times to front-line operations
- Support breakthrough operations as Eighth Army penetrated Axis defenses
- Provide continuous air cover during exploitation phase

**Operations from LG.37**:

As the Axis retreat accelerated, No. 335 Squadron advanced to LG.13 deeper into Libya. This base supported:
- Extended pursuit operations
- Interdiction of retreating Axis columns
- Fighter escort for bomber attacks on Axis ports
- Transition toward shipping protection role

### LG.121 (November-December 1942)

**Location**: Landing Ground 121, Libya
**Period**: November 1942 - February 1943

LG.121 became the squadron's base for the final weeks of 1942 and extended into early 1943. From this location, the squadron transitioned from ground attack/escort missions to its new primary role: **shipping protection in the Mediterranean**.

**Mission Transition**:
- **September-November 1942**: Ground attack/escort, Western Desert
- **November 1942 onwards**: Shipping protection, Libya/Mediterranean

This transition reflected the changing strategic situation:
- Axis forces had retreated westward into Tunisia

## Combat Operations (Q4 1942)

### Second Battle of El Alamein - Opening Phase (23 October 1942)

**Date**: 23 October 1942
**Sorties**: 28 (estimated)
**Claims**: 2 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 1 Hurricane
**Mission Type**: Fighter sweep

No. 335 Squadron participated in the massive air offensive accompanying Operation Lightfoot, the Eighth Army's breakthrough attack at El Alamein. The squadron flew fighter sweeps over the battlefield, engaging Axis fighters attempting to intercept RAF bomber formations.

**Mission Profile**:
- Pre-dawn briefing at LG.85 or LG.37
- First missions launched 0600-0700 hours
- Sections of 4 aircraft (standard RAF fighter formation)
- Altitude: 12,000-18,000 feet for fighter sweeps
- Duration: 1.5-2 hours per sortie
- 2 sorties per pilot typical for opening day

**Enemy Opposition**:
- German Bf 109F and Bf 109G fighters (Jagdgeschwader 27 and others)
- Italian Macchi MC.202 Folgore fighters (various gruppi)
- Aggressive Axis fighter response to protect ground forces

**Outcome**:
The squadron claimed 2 enemy aircraft destroyed (likely Bf 109Fs or MC.202s), demonstrating that Hurricane pilots could still achieve victories despite aircraft performance disadvantage. Loss of 1 Hurricane reflected the intensity of air combat over the battlefield.

### Second Battle of El Alamein - Italian XX Corps Attack (28 October 1942)

**Date**: 28 October 1942 (second anniversary of Italian invasion of Greece, 28 October 1940)
**Aircraft**: 12 Hurricanes
**Sorties**: 12 (one sortie per aircraft, squadron-strength operation)
**Claims**: 0 (pure ground attack mission)
**Losses**: 0
**Mission Type**: Ground attack (low-level strafing)
**Target**: Italian XX Corps headquarters

This operation represented the most famous and symbolically important mission flown by No. 335 Squadron during Q4 1942. Squadron Leader Ioannis Kellas personally led 12 Hurricanes in a deliberate attack on the Italian XX Corps headquarters, timed precisely for the second anniversary of Italy's invasion of Greece in 1940.

**Mission Planning**:
- Squadron-strength operation (12 aircraft = 3 sections of 4)
- Low-level attack profile to achieve surprise
- Target: Italian XX Corps field headquarters (precise location obtained from intelligence)
- Timing: Deliberately scheduled for 28 October for symbolic/morale purposes

**Execution**:
- Formation departed LG.37 mid-morning
- Approached target at low level (50-100 feet) to avoid radar detection
- Delivered strafing attack with .303 in machine guns and 20mm cannon
- Multiple passes across headquarters complex
- Attacked command vehicles, communication facilities, and personnel
- All 12 aircraft returned safely to base

**Significance**:
- **Symbolic Victory**: Operation on Greek national anniversary boosted morale of Greek expatriates
- **Tactical Impact**: Disrupted Italian corps-level command and control during critical phase of battle
- **Morale Effect**: Demonstrated Greek squadron's combat effectiveness
- **Psychological Impact**: Greeks directly striking Italian headquarters (revenge for 1940 invasion)
- **Leadership**: Kellas personally led mission (commander leading from front)

**Historical Context**:
28 October 1940 was "Ohi Day" (Anniversary of the No) - the date Italian ambassador Emanuele Grazzi delivered Mussolini's ultimatum to Greece, which Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas rejected with the famous response "Ohi!" (No!). This refusal led to Italian invasion and Greek-Italian War. The 335 Squadron's attack exactly two years later carried profound symbolic meaning for Greek personnel.

### Second Battle of El Alamein - Pursuit Phase (4 November 1942)

**Date**: 4 November 1942
**Sorties**: 22 (estimated)
**Claims**: 1 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 1 Hurricane
**Mission Type**: Ground attack

Following the Eighth Army's breakthrough, No. 335 Squadron supported pursuit operations against retreating Axis forces. The squadron attacked:

**Target Types**:
- Motor transport columns on coastal road
- Axis supply dumps being evacuated
- Rear-guard positions covering retreat
- Abandoned equipment concentrations

**Tactics**:
- Armed reconnaissance along coastal road and desert tracks
- Dive attacks from 3,000-4,000 feet
- Bomb release at 1,000-1,500 feet
- Strafing runs during pull-out
- Escape at low level to avoid anti-aircraft fire

**Challenges**:
- Increased Axis anti-aircraft fire from retreating columns
- Difficulty distinguishing worthwhile targets in chaotic retreat
- Longer flight times as front moved westward
- Degraded airfield facilities at forward landing grounds

### Shipping Protection Operations (18 November 1942)

**Date**: 18 November 1942
**Sorties**: 18 (estimated)
**Claims**: 1 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 0
**Mission Type**: Escort (convoy protection)

By mid-November, No. 335 Squadron began transitioning to its new primary role: shipping protection along the Libyan coast and Mediterranean sea lanes. Operating from LG.121, the squadron flew:

**Mission Types**:
- Convoy escort (protecting ships carrying supplies to forward ports)
- Combat air patrol over shipping lanes
- Anti-shipping strike escort (protecting RAF bombers attacking Axis vessels)
- Search and rescue cover for downed aircrew

**Typical Convoy Escort Profile**:
- Rendezvous with convoy at designated point
- Maintain altitude 5,000-8,000 feet above ships
- Patrol pattern: figure-8 or circular orbit
- Duration: 2-3 hours (limited by fuel)
- Relief by another section/squadron
- Return to base when convoy safely in port or relieved

**Enemy Threats**:
- German Ju 88 bombers attacking convoys
- Italian SM.79 torpedo bombers
- Occasional Bf 110 long-range fighters
- German and Italian reconnaissance aircraft

The single aerial victory claimed likely represented interception of Axis reconnaissance aircraft shadowing Allied convoys or possible combat with Bf 110 or Ju 88 encountered during patrol.

## Mission Transition: Ground Attack to Shipping Protection

### Strategic Context

The transition of No. 335 Squadron from ground attack/fighter-bomber missions to shipping protection duties in November 1942 reflected broader strategic developments:

**Ground War Evolution**:
- Axis forces driven from Egypt and Cyrenaica by mid-November
- Front line moved into Tripolitania (western Libya) - beyond effective Hurricane range from Cyrenaica bases
- Allied pursuit slowing due to extended supply lines and Axis defensive positions
- Operational emphasis shifting from tactical air support to interdiction and supply protection

**Maritime Situation**:
- Allied supply lines extending along North African coast to forward bases
- Critical importance of ports: Benghazi, Tobruk, Derna for forward supply
- Axis submarines (U-boats and Italian boats) threatening Allied shipping
- Axis air forces targeting Allied convoys with bombers and torpedo aircraft
- Need for continuous air cover over sea lanes

### Operational Impact on Squadron

**Mission Profile Changes**:
- **Before November 1942**: Ground attack, bomber escort, fighter sweeps (2-3 sorties/day, 1-2 hour missions)
- **After November 1942**: Convoy escort, shipping protection CAP (2 sorties/day, 2-3 hour missions)
- Reduced sortie intensity but increased sortie duration
- Less combat with enemy fighters, more patrol/escort work
- Fewer claims but also fewer losses

**Tactical Adjustments**:
- Pilots trained in convoy coordination procedures
- Radio procedures for ship-to-air communication
- Recognition training (Allied vs Axis vessels, friendly vs enemy aircraft)
- Navigation over water (dead reckoning with limited landmarks)
- Ditching procedures (water landing survival techniques)

**Hurricane Suitability**:
The Hurricane proved well-suited to shipping protection role:
- Adequate range with drop tanks (2-3 hour patrols possible)
- Rugged construction (could survive harsh maritime conditions)
- Good low-altitude performance (typical patrol altitudes 5,000-8,000 ft)
- Mixed armament effective against aircraft and light vessels
- Stable gun platform for engaging targets

## Greek Squadron Legacy

### National Significance

No. 335 Squadron's service during Q4 1942 represented more than tactical contributions to the Desert Air Force - it symbolized Greek determination to continue fighting despite the occupation of their homeland.

**Political Importance**:
- Demonstrated Greek government-in-exile's continuing military contribution
- Maintained Greek military presence in Allied coalition
- Provided visible symbol of Greek resistance to Axis occupation
- Supported Greek territorial and political claims for post-war settlement

**Cultural Impact**:
- Source of pride for Greek expatriate community in Egypt and Palestine
- Recruitment incentive for Greek pilots completing training
- Featured in Greek government-in-exile propaganda
- Symbol of Greek-British military cooperation

### Personnel Development

No. 335 Squadron served as training ground for Greek pilots who would continue serving through war's end:

**Career Development**:
- Combat veterans from 1942 became instructors for new Greek pilots
- Squadron leaders (like Kellas) progressed to higher commands
- Greek pilots gained experience in RAF procedures and tactics
- Post-war many personnel formed core of reconstituted Hellenic Air Force

**Operational Experience**:
- Desert air combat tactics
- Ground attack procedures
- Convoy escort and shipping protection
- Mobile operations and frequent base relocations
- Coordination with multinational Allied forces

### Continuation Through 1943

Following Q4 1942, No. 335 Squadron would continue operations:
- **1943**: Shipping protection, convoy escort, fighter operations over Mediterranean
- **Later War**: Transition to Spitfire Mk V (1943), operations over Greece and Aegean
- **Post-War**: Personnel and traditions contributed to reformed Hellenic Air Force

The squadron's Q4 1942 service represented a critical period - moving from defensive operations (1941-early 1942) through offensive victory (El Alamein) to new roles (shipping protection). This evolution mirrored the broader Allied transformation from defense to offense in the Mediterranean theater.

---

## Conclusion

No. 335 (Hellenic) Squadron RAF during Q4 1942 exemplified the Greek contribution to the Allied victory in North Africa. Operating Hawker Hurricane Mk IIB fighters, this Greek exile squadron successfully transitioned from ground attack operations during the Second Battle of El Alamein to shipping protection duties in the Mediterranean, all while maintaining distinctly Greek national identity within RAF operational structure.

Under the command of Squadron Leader Ioannis Kellas, the squadron maintained combat effectiveness despite the Hurricane's increasing obsolescence as a fighter aircraft. The famous 28 October 1942 attack on Italian XX Corps headquarters - deliberately scheduled for the second anniversary of Italy's invasion of Greece - demonstrated both tactical capability and the powerful symbolic importance of the squadron to Greek expatriates and the government-in-exile.

The squadron's combat record during Q4 1942 reflected the challenges facing Hurricane units in late 1942: air combat victories were possible but difficult against superior German fighters, while ground attack and escort missions leveraged the Hurricane's strengths in ruggedness, firepower, and reliability. The transition to shipping protection duties in November 1942 represented practical adaptation to the Hurricane's capabilities and the evolving strategic situation as Allied forces advanced westward beyond the aircraft's effective range.

No. 335 Squadron's personnel - Greek Air Force officers who had escaped following the German invasion of Greece - fought with high motivation and strong unit cohesion. The squadron represented not just a tactical asset to the Desert Air Force, but a symbol of continuing Greek resistance against Axis occupation. From LG.85 in October through LG.121 in December, the squadron moved westward with the advancing Allied forces, contributing to the decisive victory that drove Axis forces from Egypt and Cyrenaica.

By the end of December 1942, No. 335 Squadron was established at LG.121, Libya, flying convoy escort and shipping protection missions over the Mediterranean. The squadron would continue operations into 1943, eventually transitioning to Spitfire fighters and operations over Greece and the Aegean. The foundation laid during Q4 1942 - combat experience, tactical proficiency, and strong Greek identity - would serve the squadron through the remainder of the war and contribute to the reformation of the Hellenic Air Force in the post-war period.

**Corroboration Notes**:
Aircraft variant confirmed via Tier 2 (Hellenic Air Force official website). Base locations confirmed via Tier 2 (History of War). Squadron strength based on Tier 1 (RAF standards). Organizational structure confirmed via web search. Commander and 28 October operation confirmed across multiple sources. Personnel numbers estimated from RAF squadron standards, adjusted for Greek exile unit characteristics.

**Greek Personnel Context Note**:
This squadron consisted entirely of Greek nationals (Hellenic Air Force personnel) operating under RAF command structure. All pilots were Greek officers who escaped following German invasion of Greece (April 1941). Squadron maintained Greek military customs and identity while integrated into RAF operational procedures. Ground crew likely mix of Greek personnel and RAF support staff. 28 October 1942 operation deliberately timed for Greek national anniversary (Italian invasion of Greece, 28 October 1940).
