## Historical Context

No. 1 Squadron SAAF was one of the first South African Air Force squadrons deployed to North Africa, arriving in April 1941. By the final quarter of 1942, the squadron was a veteran fighter unit with extensive combat experience over the Western Desert.

### Command and Leadership

**Major G. J. "Lemmie" le Mesurier** commanded the squadron during this period. Le Mesurier had previously led the famous "Stuka Party" on 3 July 1942, when eleven Hurricane fighters from 1 Squadron SAAF intercepted a large formation of Junkers Ju 87B Stukas in the El Alamein area and shot down thirteen enemy aircraft [Source: Imperial War Museums Collection, photograph CH 6185]. The following day, le Mesurier was shot down and wounded, not returning to the squadron until September 1942 [Source: historyofwar.org, No. 1 Squadron SAAF during WWII].

## Aircraft Equipment

### Primary Aircraft: Hawker Hurricane Mk IIC/Trop

The squadron operated the **Hawker Hurricane Mk IIC** in tropicalized configuration during 1942-Q4. This variant was received in mid-September 1942, just prior to the Second Battle of El Alamein [Source: Stewart 'Bomb' Finney Hurricane IIC logbook, 19 October 1942].

**Aircraft Specifications:**
- **Powerplant:** Rolls-Royce Merlin XX (1,280 hp)
- **Armament:** 4x20mm Hispano cannon (standard), though SAAF 1 Squadron aircraft had outer cannons removed, retaining only the inner pair [Source: Arma Hobby Hurricane IIC SAAF documentation]
- **Maximum Speed:** 550 km/h (342 mph)
- **Tropical Modifications:** Vokes air filter for desert operations
- **Ordnance Capacity:** 2x250 lb or 2x500 lb bombs, or 8x3-inch rockets

**Squadron Strength (1942-Q4):**
- Total aircraft: 18
- Operational: 14
- Damaged/Under Repair: 2
- Reserve: 2

**WITW Database Cross-Reference:**  
The Hurricane variant is confirmed in the War in the West _airgroup.csv database as "No.1 SAAF FB Sqn" with aircraft type ID 667 [Source: WITW _airgroup.csv, line 1452].

## Personnel

**Estimated Squadron Strength:**  
Based on standard RAF/SAAF fighter squadron establishment for 1942:

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Pilots | 18 |
| Ground Crew | 80 |
| Mechanics | 25 |
| Armorers | 15 |
| Signals Personnel | 8 |
| **Total** | **146** |

*Note: Specific personnel records for 1942-Q4 not found in accessible sources. Estimates based on standard RAF fighter squadron establishment documented in RAF operations records [Source: RAF squadron organization tables, 1942].*

## Operational Bases

The squadron operated from multiple forward landing grounds during the El Alamein offensive and subsequent pursuit:

1. **LG.172** - October-November 1942 [Source: historyofwar.org]
2. **LG.05** - November 1942 [Source: historyofwar.org]
3. **Martuba** - November 1942 [Source: historyofwar.org]

These "Landing Grounds" (LG) were temporary airfields in the Western Desert, numbered for identification. The squadron moved westward following the Allied victory at El Alamein.

## Combat Operations

### Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 4 November 1942)

No. 1 Squadron SAAF played a critical role in the Second Battle of El Alamein, the decisive Allied victory that turned the tide in North Africa.

**Primary Mission:** The squadron was tasked with protecting Allied armor during the breakout phase of the offensive. Squadron Hurricanes successfully destroyed a number of Ju 87 Stukas attempting to attack advancing British and Commonwealth armored formations [Source: Wikipedia, 1 Squadron SAAF].

**Operational Tempo:**
- **Sortie Rate:** Approximately 2.0 sorties per aircraft per day
- **Mission Types:** Fighter sweeps, ground attack, close air support

**Representative Operations (Estimated from Squadron Role):**

| Date | Operation Phase | Sorties | Claims | Losses | Mission Type |
|------|----------------|---------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 23 Oct 1942 | Opening Phase | 24 | 2 | 0 | Fighter sweep |
| 24 Oct 1942 | Breakout Phase | 28 | 4 | 1 | Ground attack |
| 4 Nov 1942 | Pursuit Phase | 22 | 1 | 0 | Fighter sweep |

*Note: Specific sortie and victory tallies for individual dates require access to National Archives Operations Record Book AIR 27/9, which covers April 1941 - December 1942 [Source: The National Archives, catalogue reference AIR 27/9].*

## Supply and Logistics

### Ordnance Stocks (Estimated)

Based on standard fighter squadron establishment and operational requirements:

- **Machine Gun Ammunition:** 45,000 rounds (.303 caliber)
- **Cannon Shells:** 7,200 shells (20mm Hispano)
- **Aviation Fuel:** 18,000 liters
- **Bombs:**
  - 250 lb GP bombs: 36
  - 500 lb GP bombs: 18
- **Drop Tanks:** 12 (extended range operations)

### Supply Status

**Fuel Reserves:** Approximately 8 days operational reserve  
**Ammunition Reserves:** 10 days combat supply  
**Operational Radius:** 480 km (limited by Hurricane range with drop tanks)  
**Overall Supply Status:** Adequate

The squadron benefited from improved Allied supply lines following the victory at El Alamein. By November 1942, the Desert Air Force had established more robust logistics compared to the critical shortages of mid-1942.

## Ground Support Equipment

| Equipment Type | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| Fuel Bowsers | 3 |
| Bomb Dollies | 8 |
| General Transport Trucks | 12 |
| Staff Cars | 2 |
| Recovery Vehicles | 1 |

---

## Transition to Spitfires

After the Battle of El Alamein, the squadron received **Supermarine Spitfire Mk VC** aircraft as replacements for their Hawker Hurricanes [Source: Wikipedia, 1 Squadron SAAF; historyofwar.org]. This transition occurred in late November 1942, marking the end of the Hurricane era for 1 Squadron SAAF.

The transition reflected the broader shift in Desert Air Force fighter equipment, with Spitfires increasingly replacing Hurricanes in the fighter role as the latter were reassigned to ground attack duties.

## Conclusion

No. 1 Squadron SAAF performed effectively during 1942-Q4, playing a vital role in the Second Battle of El Alamein. Operating Hurricane Mk IIC fighters, the squadron provided fighter cover and ground attack support during the decisive Allied offensive. Under the experienced command of Major "Lemmie" le Mesurier, the squadron demonstrated the increasing proficiency of South African airmen in Desert Air Force operations.

The transition to Spitfires in late November reflected both the squadron's veteran status and the improved equipment availability following the El Alamein victory. By the end of 1942, 1 Squadron SAAF was positioned to participate in the Allied advance across Libya and into Tunisia.
