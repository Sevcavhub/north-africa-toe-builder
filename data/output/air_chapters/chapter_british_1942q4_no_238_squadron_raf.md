## Operational Context

No. 238 Squadron RAF entered the fourth quarter of 1942 as a veteran Hurricane fighter squadron operating with the Desert Air Force in the Western Desert. The squadron had been continuously engaged in North Africa since June 1941, flying escort missions and fighter patrols throughout the desert campaign.

On 20 July 1942, Squadron Leader Roy Marples DFC was posted to take command of 238 Squadron, leading the unit through the critical period of the Second Battle of El Alamein and the subsequent pursuit operations. By Q4 1942, the squadron was equipped with Hawker Hurricane Mk IIC fighters, armed with four 20mm Hispano cannons and capable of carrying 250 lb or 500 lb bombs for ground attack missions.

## Operations - Q4 1942

### October 1942: Second Battle of El Alamein

No. 238 Squadron participated in the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 11 November 1942), flying fighter sweeps, bomber escort missions, and ground attack sorties in support of the Eighth Army's offensive. Operating from LG.154 and LG.172, the squadron maintained an intensive operational tempo throughout the battle.

The squadron's Hurricane IICs were employed in mixed roles:
- **Fighter Sweeps**: Offensive patrols to clear the skies of Luftwaffe fighters
- **Bomber Escort**: Protection for RAF light and medium bombers attacking Axis positions
- **Ground Attack**: Strafing and bombing of Axis transport, armor, and troop concentrations

### November 1942: Operation Chocolate

The squadron's most celebrated action of Q4 1942 came in mid-November with **Operation Chocolate**, described as "one of the most audacious and yet frustratingly under-reported operations of all time."

#### Operation Concept
With Axis forces in full retreat following El Alamein, Allied aircraft operating from Egyptian bases found it increasingly difficult to reach meaningful targets. The solution: establish a forward "commando-type" airfield 400 miles behind enemy lines, from which RAF fighters could strike at retreating Axis columns.

#### Execution

**13 November 1942**: 
- Early morning departure from Mersa Matruh area
- 11:30 hours: Landing at LG.125, 150 miles east of Agedabia and 150 miles south of Derna
- LG.125 positioned deep behind German lines along the coastal retreat route
- Combined force: 36 Hurricanes from Nos. 213 and 238 Squadrons

**13-16 November 1942** (Four-day operation):
- **Total Sorties**: ~180 (estimated, both squadrons combined)
- **Ground Targets Destroyed**: 
  - 300+ motor vehicles (trucks, staff cars, fuel bowsers)
  - 14 aircraft (2× Ju 52 transports, 1× Bf 109, 11 others destroyed on ground or in air)
- **Allied Losses**: 3 Hurricanes from 36 participating aircraft

Squadron Leader Roy Marples led 238 Squadron throughout Operation Chocolate, personally directing attacks from his Hurricane HL609. The operation achieved complete tactical surprise, with the Hurricanes appearing unexpectedly over Axis columns streaming westward along the coastal road.

#### Results & Recognition

The four-day operation inflicted severe losses on retreating Axis forces:
- Squadron destroyed or disabled ~150 vehicles (238 Squadron's estimated share)
- Disrupted enemy withdrawal and captured equipment evacuation
- Demonstrated viability of forward air operations behind enemy lines

For his leadership during Operation Chocolate and related operations in November 1942, Squadron Leader Marples was awarded a **Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross** (DFC & Bar). The citation noted his unit's destruction of "50 and disabled 90 more transports and 3 aircraft" during intensive attacks on enemy supply lines.

### December 1942: Transition Phase

Following Operation Chocolate, 238 Squadron withdrew to Egypt for:
- Air defense duties protecting rear areas
- Rest and refit after intensive combat operations
- Preparation for eventual conversion to Spitfire fighters (completed September 1943)

The squadron operated from Martuba (November 1942 - January 1943), conducting defensive patrols and limited offensive operations as the front line moved westward into Libya and Tunisia.

**LG Characteristics**:
- Rapid establishment (hours to days)
- Minimal infrastructure (tents, fuel dumps, basic workshops)
- Highly mobile - squadrons relocated frequently
- Vulnerable to dust storms and enemy air attack
- Required constant maintenance to prevent surface deterioration

**238 Squadron LGs - Q4 1942**:
- **LG.154**: September-October 1942
- **LG.172**: October-November 1942  
- **LG.125**: Operation Chocolate (13-16 November 1942) - behind enemy lines
- **LG.20**: November 1942
- **LG.101**: November 1942

Permanent bases like **El Adem** and **Martuba** offered more substantial facilities but were still austere by UK standards.

### Appendix C: Operation Chocolate - Tactical Analysis

**Operational Concept**:
- **Objective**: Interdict retreating Axis forces beyond normal fighter range
- **Method**: Establish forward operating base 400 miles behind enemy lines
- **Force**: 36× Hurricane IIC from Nos. 213 & 238 Squadrons
- **Duration**: 4 days (13-16 November 1942)

**Tactical Execution**:
1. **Infiltration**: Low-level flight to LG.125, avoiding detection
2. **Base Establishment**: Minimal ground crew, pre-positioned fuel/ammo
3. **Strike Operations**: Multiple daily sorties against coastal road targets
4. **Exfiltration**: Withdrawal before German reaction force arrived

**Results**:
- 300+ vehicles destroyed
- 14 aircraft destroyed
- 3 Hurricanes lost (~8% loss rate)
- Complete tactical surprise achieved
- Enemy retreat disrupted

**Historical Impact**:
Operation Chocolate demonstrated the viability of deep penetration air operations and presaged later forward air control techniques. The operation's success validated aggressive employment of single-engine fighters beyond traditional support ranges when supported by forward logistics.
