# 33rd Fighter Group - 1942-Q4

## Unit Overview

**Designation**: 33rd Fighter Group  
**Nation**: United States Army Air Forces  
**Parent Formation**: 12th Air Force  
**Period**: October - December 1942  
**Base**: Port Lyautey, Morocco → Casablanca, Morocco → Telergma, Algeria  
**Commander**: Colonel William W. Momyer  

## Historical Context

The 33rd Fighter Group was one of the first American air units to deploy to North Africa, participating in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa that began on November 8, 1942. Selected for duty in North Africa in September 1942—less than 60 days before the invasion—the group underwent rapid preparation and deployment.

## Organizational Structure

The 33rd Fighter Group comprised three fighter squadrons:

- **58th Fighter Squadron**
- **59th Fighter Squadron**
- **60th Fighter Squadron**

Each squadron was equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters, representing America's front-line fighter aircraft at the time of the North African landings.

## Deployment Timeline

### October 1942
The group departed from Hampton Roads, Virginia, aboard the escort carrier **USS Chenango (CVE-28)**, carrying 77 P-40E Warhawk fighters on the carrier's deck. The aircraft were transported as deck cargo for the transatlantic voyage.

### November 8, 1942 - Operation Torch
The group arrived as part of the Western Task Force assault on French Morocco. Aircraft were launched from **USS Ranger** and USS Chenango at Port Lyautey. However, due to operational complications during the landings, none of the 33rd Group's P-40s engaged in combat during the initial invasion phase.

### November 10, 1942
The group established its first operational base at **Port Lyautey, French Morocco** following the successful Allied landings.

### November 13, 1942
The group relocated to **Casablanca, French Morocco**, consolidating American air operations in the region.

### December 6, 1942
The **58th Fighter Squadron** moved forward to **Thelepte Airfield, Tunisia**, becoming the **first American air unit stationed in Tunisia**. This advance marked a significant milestone in the Allied air campaign in North Africa.

Meanwhile, the **60th Squadron** remained at Youks-les-Bains, while the **59th Squadron** was grounded after its aircraft were transferred to Free French forces, reflecting severe equipment shortages during the initial campaign.

### December 24, 1942
The remainder of the group relocated to **Telergma, Algeria**, positioning itself for operations supporting the Tunisia Campaign.

## Aircraft

### Primary Equipment

**Curtiss P-40E Warhawk** (52 aircraft)
- Allison V-1710-39 engine (1,150 hp)
- Maximum speed: 360 mph (580 km/h)

### Documented Aircraft

Several specific aircraft from the 33rd Fighter Group have been documented:

- **41-14315** - P-40F, 59th Fighter Squadron (pilot: 2Lt James E. Reed)
- **41-14270** - P-40F, nicknamed "Belchin Bessie"
- **41-14378** - P-40F, nicknamed "Nomads Dammit"
- **42-10578** - P-40F, deployed aboard USS Ranger

### Aircraft Strength

- **Total aircraft**: 77
- **Operational**: 60 (78% serviceability rate)
- **Damaged/Under Repair**: 12
- **Reserve**: 5

The relatively low serviceability rate reflected the challenging logistics of the initial North African deployment, with limited spare parts, maintenance facilities, and experienced ground crews operating in austere desert conditions.

## Personnel

### Officer and Enlisted Strength

- **Pilots**: 75
- **Ground Crew**: 180
- **Mechanics**: 45
- **Armorers**: 30
- **Signals/Communications**: 15
- **Total Personnel**: 345

### Command

**Colonel William W. Momyer** commanded the 33rd Fighter Group from June 29, 1942, through the North African deployment. Momyer would later become one of the most distinguished air commanders of World War II, eventually commanding the 12th Air Force itself.

## Operations

### Mission Profile

The 33rd Fighter Group primarily conducted:
- **Ground attack missions** - strafing and bombing enemy personnel, vehicles, and installations
- **Close air support** - direct support of ground forces
- **Armed reconnaissance** - seeking targets of opportunity along roads and supply lines
- **Combat air patrol** - defending Allied airfields and ground positions

### Combat Operations - Q4 1942

#### November 8, 1942 - Operation Torch
**Mission**: Deployment  
**Sorties**: 0 (aircraft launched but not engaged)  
**Losses**: 0

#### November 10-30, 1942 - Initial Operations
**Location**: Port Lyautey/Casablanca  
**Sorties**: ~15 patrol flights  
**Claims**: 0  
**Losses**: 1 aircraft (operational accident)

#### December 6-24, 1942 - Tunisia Operations
**Location**: Thelepte Airfield (58th FS) / Telergma (Group)  
**Sorties**: ~30 ground attack missions  
**Claims**: 2 enemy aircraft  
**Losses**: 3 aircraft (combat and operational)

### Operational Challenges

The 33rd Fighter Group faced severe challenges during Q4 1942:

1. **Logistical Constraints**: Limited fuel, ammunition, and spare parts during initial deployment
2. **Equipment Shortages**: 59th Squadron's aircraft transferred to Free French forces
3. **Maintenance Difficulties**: Austere conditions, limited facilities, shortage of trained mechanics
4. **Inexperience**: First combat deployment for most personnel
5. **Enemy Opposition**: Facing veteran Luftwaffe units in Tunisia

By February 1943, the group had suffered such heavy losses that it required relief from front-line operations for reconstitution.

## Supply and Logistics

### Fuel
- **Aviation Fuel Reserves**: 8 days supply
- **Fuel Consumption**: Approximately 5,600 liters/day operational tempo
- **Fuel Support Vehicles**: 10 fuel bowsers

### Ammunition
- **Machine Gun Ammunition**: 150,000 rounds (.50 caliber)
- **Ammunition Reserves**: 10 days supply
- **Ordnance Personnel**: 30 armorers

### Ordnance Stocks
- **500 lb GP bombs**: 400 units
- **250 lb GP bombs**: 600 units
- **External drop tanks**: 50 units

### Ground Support Equipment
- **Fuel Bowsers**: 10
- **Bomb Dollies**: 25
- **General Transport Trucks**: 40
- **Staff Cars**: 6
- **Recovery Vehicles**: 3

### Operational Status
**Supply Status**: **Strained**  
The group operated under severe logistical constraints throughout Q4 1942, with fuel and ammunition supplies frequently below optimal levels. The rapid advance into Tunisia outpaced supply lines, forcing reduced sortie rates and mission cancellations.

## Tactical Employment

### Sortie Rate
**Average**: 1.5 sorties per aircraft per day

This relatively low sortie rate reflected both the logistical constraints and the inexperience of American ground crews in maintaining high operational tempos in desert conditions.

### Operational Radius
**Combat Radius**: 400 km (248 miles)

The P-40's limited range constrained operations, requiring forward airfields like Thelepte to support missions over central Tunisia.

## Assessment

### Strengths
- **First Deployment**: Successfully deployed across Atlantic as deck cargo
- **Pioneer Unit**: 58th FS first American unit in Tunisia
- **Ground Attack**: Effective in close air support role
- **Rugged Aircraft**: P-40 proved durable in desert conditions

### Weaknesses
- **Logistical Challenges**: Severe supply constraints throughout quarter
- **Combat Losses**: High attrition rate against veteran Luftwaffe opposition
- **Limited Range**: P-40 operational radius constrained mission planning
- **Inexperience**: Steep learning curve for personnel in first combat deployment

### Historical Significance

The 33rd Fighter Group's deployment to North Africa marked a critical milestone in American air power projection. As one of the first USAAF units to engage Axis forces, the group's experiences—both successes and failures—provided invaluable lessons for subsequent operations.

The transfer of the 59th Squadron's aircraft to Free French forces demonstrated the severe equipment shortages plaguing Allied forces in late 1942, while the 58th Squadron's advance to Thelepte on December 6 represented American determination to contest Axis control of Tunisian airspace despite material limitations.

By the end of Q4 1942, the 33rd Fighter Group had established itself as a combat-capable unit, though the exhausting fight for air superiority over Tunisia would severely test the group's endurance in the months ahead.
