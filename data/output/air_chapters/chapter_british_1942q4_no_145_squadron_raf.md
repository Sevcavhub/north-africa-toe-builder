## 4. Historical Context: First Spitfires in the Western Desert

### Strategic Significance

No. 145 Squadron's deployment represented a critical turning point in the Desert Air War. Prior to May 1942, RAF fighter strength in the Western Desert relied primarily on:
- **Hawker Hurricane Mk I/II**: Reliable but outclassed by Bf 109F
- **Curtiss Tomahawk/Kittyhawk**: Good at low altitude, limited high-altitude performance
- **Bristol Beaufighter**: Effective but primarily long-range fighter/ground attack role

The arrival of Spitfire VBs provided the Desert Air Force with a fighter capable of meeting the Bf 109F on equal or superior terms at all altitudes.

### Deployment Timeline

**February 1942**: Squadron departed United Kingdom for Middle East
**April 1942**: Arrived Egypt, began receiving Spitfire VB aircraft at Helwan (on Nile south of Cairo)
**24 May 1942**: Moved forward to Gambut (between Tobruk and Bardia)
**1 June 1942**: Commenced defensive patrol operations
**8 June 1942**: **First Spitfire air victory in Western Desert**
- Flt Lt Sabourin and Sgt James engaged two Bf 109s southwest of Tobruk
- One Bf 109 destroyed (confirmed)

### Tactical Impact

The Spitfire VB's arrival forced Luftwaffe tactical adjustments:
- **Performance Advantage**: Superior rate of climb and turning performance vs Bf 109F
- **Altitude Dominance**: Could engage at heights previously dominated by German fighters
- **Psychological Effect**: Allied pilots' morale significantly improved with superior equipment
- **Operational Freedom**: RAF bombers received more effective escort
