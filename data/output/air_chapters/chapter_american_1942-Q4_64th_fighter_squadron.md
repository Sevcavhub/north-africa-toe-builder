# 64th Fighter Squadron (Fighter), 57th Fighter Group - 1942-Q4

## Unit Overview

The 64th Fighter Squadron was one of three squadrons comprising the 57th Fighter Group, alongside the 65th and 66th Fighter Squadrons. Formed in January 1941 at Mitchel Field, New York as part of the Army Air Corps Northeast Defense Sector, the squadron initially provided air defense duties along the northeastern United States following the attack on Pearl Harbor.[1]

## Deployment to North Africa

In June 1942, the squadron received a dramatic new assignment: deployment to the Middle East to support British forces in North Africa. The pilots and ground crew, along with 72 brand-new Curtiss P-40F-1-CU Warhawk fighters, loaded aboard the aircraft carrier USS Ranger at Quonset Point, Rhode Island on July 1, 1942.[2]

On July 19, 1942, off the Gold Coast of Africa, the P-40F aircraft launched from the Ranger in four sections of 18 aircraft each. The pilots flew to Accra (in present-day Ghana), then undertook a grueling trans-African flight across Equatorial Africa to Palestine, officially joining IX Fighter Command of the U.S. Army Middle East Air Force.[3]

### The P-40F-1 Warhawk

The squadron's P-40F-1-CU aircraft represented a significant improvement over earlier P-40 variants. Unlike the Allison-powered P-40E, the P-40F featured the American-made Packard V-1650-1 engine, a license-built version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin XX producing 1,300 horsepower.[4]

**Key Specifications:**
- **Engine:** Packard V-1650-1 (Merlin XX derivative), 1,300 HP
- **Armament:** Six .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns in wings
- **Top Speed:** 364 mph at 15,000 feet
- **Service Ceiling:** Approximately 20,000 feet (effective combat ceiling)
- **Range:** 750 km combat radius (with drop tanks)
- **Fuselage:** Short-tail variant (9.5 m / 31 ft 2 in length)

The P-40F-1 retained the short fuselage of the P-40E; later production P-40F-5 and subsequent variants featured a lengthened fuselage (33 ft 4 in) to counteract the additional torque from the more powerful Merlin engine.[5]

## Training and Preparation

Upon arrival in Palestine in late July 1942, the 57th Fighter Group underwent intensive training with Royal Air Force (RAF) units to learn desert warfare tactics and operational procedures. Prior to the group officially beginning combat operations as a complete formation in October 1942, individual pilots from the 64th, 65th, and 66th Fighter Squadrons were attached to RAF, South African Air Force (SAAF), and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-40 Kittyhawk squadrons belonging to No. 211 Group, Desert Air Force.[6]

This attachment period was invaluable, allowing American pilots to gain combat experience under the tutelage of battle-hardened Commonwealth aviators who had been fighting in the desert since 1940.

## Operational Bases - October-December 1942

### LG-174 (Landing Ground 174) - September 16 to November 5, 1942

The 64th Fighter Squadron's first operational base was Landing Ground 174 (LG-174), located approximately 80 kilometers southwest of Alexandria, Egypt, east of the El Alamein defensive line.[7] From this forward airstrip, the squadron participated in the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein beginning October 23, 1942.

### RAF El Daba (LG-105) - November 5-8, 1942

As British Eighth Army forces broke through Axis defenses and began their westward pursuit, the 64th Fighter Squadron advanced to RAF El Daba (also known as Desert Landing Ground 105) for three days of operations supporting the advancing ground forces.[8]

### Sidi Haneish Airfield - November 8-12, 1942

By November 8, the squadron had moved to Sidi Haneish Airfield, located about 35 kilometers east-southeast of Marsa Matruh in the western desert. From here, the unit continued flying ground attack and fighter sweep missions against retreating Axis forces during the Libyan Pursuit Operations.[9]

## Combat Operations - Fourth Quarter 1942

### Second Battle of El Alamein (October 23 - November 4, 1942)

The 57th Fighter Group officially began combat operations as a complete formation in October 1942, with the 64th Fighter Squadron playing a crucial role in providing air support during the Second Battle of El Alamein.[10]

The squadron's missions included:
- **Fighter sweeps** to achieve air superiority over the battlefield
- **Ground attack missions** targeting Axis armored formations, vehicle columns, and supply lines
- **Bomber escort** missions protecting Allied medium and light bombers attacking Axis rear areas
- **Interdiction missions** disrupting Axis supply convoys along coastal roads

The P-40F proved effective in the low-altitude ground attack and air superiority roles, though its single-stage supercharger limited high-altitude performance compared to German Bf 109F and G variants operated by Luftwaffe units in North Africa.

### Libyan Pursuit Operations (November-December 1942)

Following the breakthrough at El Alamein, British Eighth Army pursued retreating Axis forces westward across Libya. The 64th Fighter Squadron maintained continuous pressure on withdrawing enemy forces, flying multiple daily sorties from advancing forward airstrips.[11]

Operations during this period were characterized by:
- High sortie rates (averaging 1-2 sorties per pilot per day)
- Rapid base relocations to maintain proximity to the front line
- Focus on ground attack missions targeting vehicles, airfields, and supply dumps
- Occasional air-to-air engagements with Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica fighters providing rear-guard cover

## Supply and Logistics

Operating from primitive desert landing grounds presented significant logistical challenges. The 64th Fighter Squadron relied on:

- **Fuel supplies** transported by truck convoy from Alexandria and forward supply dumps
- **Ammunition** for the six .50 caliber machine guns (averaging 14 days of reserves)
- **Spare parts** scavenged from damaged aircraft and supplemented by supply deliveries
- **Ordnance** including 500-lb (227 kg) and 250-lb (113 kg) general-purpose bombs
- **Drop tanks** to extend operational radius for escort and interdiction missions

Supply status during Q4 1942 was generally adequate, though the rapid advance westward occasionally strained logistics as supply lines lengthened.[12]

## Recognition and Achievement

For their front-line operations in direct support of British Eighth Army from the Battle of El Alamein through the eventual capitulation of Axis forces in Sicily, the 57th Fighter Group (including the 64th Fighter Squadron) received the Distinguished Unit Citation.[13] This prestigious award recognized the group's sustained combat effectiveness, high sortie rates, and significant contribution to Allied air superiority in North Africa.

## Assessment

The 64th Fighter Squadron's performance during the final quarter of 1942 established the unit as a capable combat formation. While specific victory tallies and individual pilot achievements for this period remain undocumented in available sources, the squadron's participation in the decisive El Alamein campaign and subsequent pursuit operations demonstrated the increasing capability of USAAF units in the Mediterranean Theater.

The experience gained during Q4 1942 would prove invaluable as the squadron continued operations through the Tunisia campaign, Sicily invasion, and eventually into the Italian mainland in 1943-1944.
