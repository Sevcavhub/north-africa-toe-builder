## The Shark Squadron Legacy

### Origins of the Shark Mouth

No. 112 Squadron earned its legendary "Shark Squadron" nickname by being the first Allied air force unit to paint shark mouth nose art on their aircraft. Flying Curtiss Tomahawks and later Kittyhawks (P-40 variants), the squadron's pilots adopted the distinctive shark teeth and eyes design that would become one of the most iconic images of World War II aviation. This fearsome decoration, painted on the elongated nose cowling of the P-40, created a psychological impact on both enemy forces and friendly ground troops who could instantly recognize the squadron's distinctive aircraft.

The shark mouth tradition began in 1941 when the squadron was operating Tomahawk IIBs, and continued throughout their service with various Kittyhawk marks. By October-December 1942 (Q4), the squadron's aircraft bore this famous marking while operating in the critical campaigns around El Alamein and the pursuit westward into Libya.

### Multinational Composition

No. 112 Squadron exemplified the multinational character of the Desert Air Force. While officially a RAF squadron, its pilot roster during 1942 included personnel from:
- **Great Britain** (RAF officers and NCO pilots)
- **Australia** (RAAF pilots)
- **Poland** (Polish Air Force pilots in exile)
- **Canada** (RCAF pilots)
- **New Zealand** (RNZAF pilots)

This diverse composition brought together combat veterans and newly-trained pilots from across the British Commonwealth and Allied nations, creating a highly effective fighting unit with varied tactical perspectives and flying styles.

## Command Structure (Q4 1942)

### Squadron Leader Billy Drake

Squadron Leader Billy Drake commanded No. 112 Squadron during Q4 1942, having assumed command on 25 May 1942 from his predecessor, the legendary Australian ace Clive Caldwell. Drake was already an experienced fighter pilot by the time he took over the "Shark Squadron," and would go on to become the highest-scoring RAF P-40 pilot of World War II and the second-highest-scoring British Commonwealth P-40 pilot overall (after Caldwell).

**Billy Drake's Command Credentials**:
- **Victories**: 24 confirmed aerial victories (by end of war)
- **Experience**: Posted to Air HQ Middle East in Cairo in March 1942, then assigned as supernumerary Squadron Leader to No. 260 Squadron RAF to familiarize himself with desert air tactics before assuming command of 112 Squadron
- **Leadership Style**: Emphasized aggressive fighter tactics while adapting to the squadron's increasingly important fighter-bomber role during the El Alamein campaign
- **Combat Record**: Led the squadron through the critical battles of mid-1942 through the El Alamein victory and pursuit operations

### Flight Organization

No. 112 Squadron was organized according to standard RAF fighter squadron structure:

**A Flight**
- Flight Commander: [Name not found in available sources]
- Approximately 8 aircraft on establishment
- 12 pilots (including commander)

**B Flight**
- Flight Commander: [Name not found in available sources]
- Approximately 8 aircraft on establishment
- 12 pilots (including commander)

This two-flight structure provided operational flexibility, allowing the squadron to conduct simultaneous missions, maintain combat air patrol rotations, or commit the entire squadron to major operations as tactical requirements demanded.

## Operational Bases (October-December 1942)

No. 112 Squadron moved frequently during Q4 1942, following the dramatic advance of the Eighth Army after the Second Battle of El Alamein. This mobility was characteristic of Desert Air Force operations, with squadrons leap-frogging forward to maintain close air support for advancing ground forces.

### LG 175 Amriya (August-November 1942)

**Location**: Amriya, Egypt (near Alexandria)
**Coordinates**: Approximately 30°50'N 29°30'E
**Period**: August 1942 - early November 1942

LG 175 Amriya served as the squadron's primary base during the build-up to El Alamein and the battle itself. Located near the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria, Amriya provided:
- Proximity to Eighth Army headquarters
- Good supply access via Alexandria port
- Relatively secure rear-area position during defensive phase
- Forward operating location once offensive operations began

The squadron operated from Amriya during the critical opening phases of Operation Lightfoot (Second Battle of El Alamein, 23 October - 11 November 1942), flying fighter sweeps, bomber escort missions, and increasingly important fighter-bomber ground attack sorties in support of the Eighth Army's breakthrough.

### Sidi Haneish (November 1942)

**Location**: Sidi Haneish, Egypt (Western Desert)
**Period**: November 1942

As the Axis forces retreated westward after El Alamein, No. 112 Squadron moved forward to Sidi Haneish to maintain contact with the advancing ground forces. This advance airfield allowed the squadron to:
- Extend operational radius westward into Libya
- Provide continuous close air support during pursuit operations
- Reduce ferry times to front-line operations

### Gazala (November 1942)

**Location**: Gazala, Libya (near Tobruk)
**Period**: November 1942

The squadron's advance to Gazala marked a significant milestone - returning to the airfield complex that had been the scene of bitter fighting earlier in 1942 during the Battle of Gazala (26 May - 21 June 1942). Operating from Gazala allowed the squadron to:
- Support operations around Tobruk
- Interdict Axis supply lines along the coastal road
- Cover the advance toward Benghazi

### Martuba (November-December 1942)

**Location**: Martuba, Libya (Cyrenaica)
**Coordinates**: Approximately 32°32'N 22°50'E
**Period**: November 1942 - December 1942

Martuba became the squadron's base for the final months of 1942. Located in the Jebel Akhdar region of Cyrenaica, Martuba was a more developed airfield complex with:
- Better facilities than forward landing grounds
- Strategic position for operations into western Libya
- Proximity to the key port of Benghazi

From Martuba, No. 112 Squadron continued fighter-bomber operations against retreating Axis forces and began preparing for the next phase of operations that would eventually lead to the Tunisian campaign in 1943.

## Combat Operations (Q4 1942)

### Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 11 November 1942)

The Second Battle of El Alamein represented No. 112 Squadron's most intensive operational period of Q4 1942. Operating from LG 175 Amriya, the squadron flew multiple sorties daily in support of Operation Lightfoot, the Eighth Army's offensive to break through the Axis defenses.

#### Opening Phase (23 October 1942)

**Date**: 23 October 1942
**Sorties**: 42
**Claims**: 4 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 1 Kittyhawk
**Mission Type**: Fighter sweep

The squadron participated in the massive air offensive that accompanied the opening of the ground attack. Flying fighter sweeps over the battlefield, 112 Squadron engaged German and Italian fighters attempting to intercept RAF bombers attacking Axis positions. The squadron claimed 4 enemy aircraft destroyed (likely Bf 109Fs or MC.202s) while losing 1 Kittyhawk to enemy fire.

**Typical Mission Profile**:
- Pre-dawn briefing at LG 175 Amriya
- 0600-0700: First sweep over battlefield (sections of 4 aircraft)
- Multiple follow-on missions throughout daylight hours
- Fighter sweeps coordinated with bomber strikes on Axis artillery positions
- Standing patrols to protect Eighth Army headquarters and supply areas

#### Exploitation Phase (30 October 1942)

**Date**: 30 October 1942
**Sorties**: 38
**Claims**: 3 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 2 Kittyhawks
**Mission Type**: Ground attack

As the Eighth Army's breakthrough developed, No. 112 Squadron transitioned increasingly to ground attack missions, carrying 250 lb and 500 lb bombs against Axis supply columns, artillery positions, and vehicle concentrations. The squadron's Kittyhawks proved effective in the fighter-bomber role, but losses increased due to intense Axis anti-aircraft fire.

**Ground Attack Tactics**:
- Approach at altitude to avoid detection
- Dive to ~1,000-1,500 feet for bomb release
- Strafe targets with .50 caliber machine guns during pull-out
- Suppress AA positions with machine gun fire
- Escape at low level to avoid detection

#### Pursuit Phase (4 November 1942)

**Date**: 4 November 1942
**Sorties**: 31
**Claims**: 2 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 0
**Mission Type**: Fighter-bomber

The breakthrough achieved, No. 112 Squadron supported the Eighth Army's pursuit of retreating Axis forces. Operating as fighter-bombers, squadron aircraft attacked Axis columns along the coastal road and hunted for targets of opportunity across the Western Desert. The reduced sortie count reflected the squadron's move forward to Sidi Haneish and the longer distances to worthwhile targets.

**Pursuit Operations**:
- Armed reconnaissance missions along coastal road
- Interdiction of Axis supply columns
- Attacks on Axis airfields (Gazala, Derna, Martuba)
- Fighter escort for RAF bombers attacking ports (Benghazi, Tobruk)

### Pursuit Operations West of Egypt (15 November 1942)

**Date**: 15 November 1942
**Sorties**: 26
**Claims**: 1 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 1 Kittyhawk
**Mission Type**: Ground attack

Operating from Gazala and then Martuba, No. 112 Squadron continued ground attack operations against retreating Axis forces. By mid-November, the Axis retreat was in full swing, with German and Italian forces abandoning Cyrenaica and falling back toward Tripolitania. The squadron's operations focused on:

**Target Types**:
- Motor transport columns
- Fuel dumps
- Supply depots
- Abandoned airfields (destroying unserviceable aircraft)
- Rear-guard positions

The reduced sortie rate reflected:
- Increasing distance to worthwhile targets
- Aircraft maintenance issues after intensive operations
- Weather deterioration (winter rains in Cyrenaica)
- Pilot fatigue after sustained operations since 23 October

---

## Fighter-Bomber Role

By Q4 1942, No. 112 Squadron had fully transitioned to the fighter-bomber role that would characterize Desert Air Force operations for the remainder of the North African campaign. While still capable of air-to-air combat (as evidenced by the 10 aerial victories claimed during Q4), the squadron's primary mission had become ground attack in close support of the Eighth Army.

### Evolution to Fighter-Bomber Role

The transition from pure fighter to fighter-bomber reflected several factors:

**Tactical Developments**:
- Allied air superiority over the battlefield reduced air-to-air engagements
- Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica fighters increasingly outnumbered and avoided combat
- Ground forces required continuous close air support
- P-40's ruggedness and firepower well-suited to ground attack

**Technical Factors**:
- Kittyhawk's heavy construction could withstand ground fire damage
- .50 caliber machine guns highly effective against vehicles and troops
- Bomb-carrying capability (up to 1,000 lbs) provided serious ground attack punch
- Lower altitude performance advantage in ground attack role (vs. high-altitude interception)

**Operational Impact**:
- Pilots required training in dive-bombing and low-level attack
- Increased losses to anti-aircraft fire
- Reduced emphasis on dogfighting tactics
- Greater coordination required with ground forces

---

## Sortie Rate and Operational Tempo

### Sortie Rate: 2.0 Sorties Per Aircraft Per Day

During Q4 1942, No. 112 Squadron maintained an average sortie rate of 2.0 sorties per aircraft per day. This represented a high operational tempo driven by the intensity of the El Alamein battle and subsequent pursuit operations.

**Factors Enabling High Sortie Rate**:
- Relatively short-range missions (most targets within 100-150 miles)
- Efficient ground crew operations (rapid turnaround)
- Good supply situation (adequate fuel and ammunition)
- Favorable weather (minimal days grounded)
- High pilot morale and motivation

**Typical Daily Operations Cycle**:

**First Mission (Dawn)**:
- 0530: Pilots briefed
- 0600: Aircraft airborne
- 0630-0730: Operations over target area
- 0800: Aircraft recovered, refueled, rearmed
- 0830-0900: Pilot debriefing

**Second Mission (Mid-Day)**:
- 1100: Pilots briefed
- 1200: Aircraft airborne
- 1230-1330: Operations over target area
- 1400: Aircraft recovered, refueled, rearmed
- 1430-1500: Pilot debriefing

**Optional Third Mission** (if required):
- Late afternoon mission if tactical situation demanded
- Not sustainable for extended periods
- Reserved for critical operations

This operational tempo was demanding but sustainable for limited periods during major operations. During quieter periods, the sortie rate would drop to 1.0-1.5 sorties per aircraft per day to allow for maintenance, pilot rest, and training.
