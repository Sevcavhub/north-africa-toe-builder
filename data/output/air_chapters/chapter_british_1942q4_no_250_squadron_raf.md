## Sudan Heritage

### Squadron Nickname and Identity

No. 250 Squadron carried the unofficial nickname "Sudan Squadron," reflecting its wartime association with Sudan and the broader East African theater. While the squadron's operational focus during Q4 1942 was the Western Desert Campaign, this Sudan connection remained part of the squadron's identity and heritage.

The squadron's aircraft carried the two-letter code **"LD"** followed by an individual aircraft letter (LD-A through LD-Z). A distinctive squadron marking was a **red arrow painted over the exhaust stubs** on each aircraft, providing quick visual identification of 250 Squadron Kittyhawks.

### Formation and Early War Service

Originally formed in 1918 during the First World War, No. 250 Squadron was reformed in 1940 for service in the Second World War. The squadron initially operated various aircraft types before converting to the Curtiss Tomahawk in 1941. In February 1942, the squadron was withdrawn from operations for conversion to the improved Curtiss Kittyhawk fighter-bomber, completing the transition by April 1942.

- **May 1942**: Led squadron attack on large formation of Luftwaffe Ju 52 transport aircraft flying from Crete to Libya
- **Early June 1942**: Led twelve Kittyhawks on sweep toward Knightsbridge-Acroma area, damaging enemy aircraft without squadron losses

Judd's leadership style emphasized aggressive fighter tactics while adapting the squadron to its increasingly important fighter-bomber role. His experience from the first half of 1942 informed his command during the critical El Alamein period, where the squadron successfully balanced air combat capability with ground attack effectiveness.

### Flight Organization

No. 250 Squadron followed standard RAF fighter squadron organization with two flights:

**A Flight**
- Flight Commander: [Name not found in available sources]
- Approximately 8 aircraft on establishment
- 12 pilots (including commander)

**B Flight**
- Flight Commander: [Name not found in available sources]
- Approximately 8 aircraft on establishment
- 12 pilots (including commander)

This two-flight structure provided operational flexibility, allowing the squadron to conduct simultaneous missions, maintain combat air patrol rotations, or commit the entire squadron to major operations as required by tactical circumstances.

## Operational Bases (October-December 1942)

No. 250 Squadron moved frequently during Q4 1942, following the dramatic advance of the Eighth Army after the Second Battle of El Alamein. This extreme mobility was characteristic of Desert Air Force operations, with squadrons repeatedly advancing to forward landing grounds to maintain close air support for the rapidly moving ground forces.

### LG 106 (October 1942)

**Location**: Landing Ground 106, Egypt (Western Desert)
**Period**: October 1942
**Status**: Operational base during El Alamein build-up and opening phase

LG 106 served as No. 250 Squadron's base during the opening phase of the Second Battle of El Alamein. This landing ground provided the squadron with:
- Proximity to Eighth Army positions along the El Alamein line
- Forward staging for Operation Lightfoot (El Alamein offensive, 23 October 1942)
- Relatively short distances to front-line targets
- Access to supply lines from Alexandria and Cairo

From LG 106, the squadron launched fighter sweeps, bomber escort missions, and fighter-bomber ground attack sorties during the critical opening days of the El Alamein offensive.

### Multiple Forward Landing Grounds (November 1942)

**Locations**: LG 106, LG 101, LG 76, Gambut 1, Gambut 2
**Period**: November 1942
**Status**: Rapid advance and base relocation

November 1942 witnessed No. 250 Squadron's most rapid series of base changes, reflecting the Eighth Army's breakthrough and pursuit of retreating Axis forces. The squadron relocated through a series of forward landing grounds:

**LG 106**: Retained briefly into early November during final El Alamein operations

**LG 101**: Advanced position closer to the front as Eighth Army broke through Axis defenses

**LG 76**: Further advance westward as pursuit operations intensified

**Gambut 1 and Gambut 2**: Landing grounds near Gambut, Libya
- Located near the coastal road in eastern Libya
- Strategic position for interdicting retreating Axis columns
- Proximity to Tobruk (recently liberated)
- Forward staging for operations deeper into Cyrenaica

This pattern of frequent moves meant the squadron's ground crews became expert at rapid deployment and establishment of forward operating locations. Each move required:
- Dismantling temporary facilities
- Road transport of ground equipment and personnel
- Establishing new dispersal areas at forward landing ground
- Setting up fuel and ammunition dumps
- Re-establishing communications and command posts
- Often accomplished within 24-48 hours

### Martuba 4 (November-December 1942)

**Location**: Martuba airfield complex, Libya (Cyrenaica, Jebel Akhdar region)
**Coordinates**: Approximately 32°32'N 22°50'E
**Period**: November 1942 - December 1942
**Status**: Primary operational base, late Q4 1942

Martuba served as No. 250 Squadron's primary base for the final weeks of 1942. Located in the Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) region of Cyrenaica, Martuba was a more developed airfield complex compared to the rudimentary forward landing grounds:

**Facilities**:
- Multiple prepared landing strips (Martuba 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Better dispersal areas for aircraft protection
- More substantial infrastructure for maintenance
- Proximity to road network for supply
- Natural concealment from terrain features

**Strategic Position**:
- Forward base for operations into western Libya
- Coverage of Benghazi area
- Interdiction of coastal road supply routes
- Support for Eighth Army advance toward Tripolitania

From Martuba, No. 250 Squadron continued fighter-bomber operations against retreating Axis forces while beginning to prepare for the next phase of operations that would eventually lead to the Tunisian campaign in 1943.

### Belandah 1 (December 1942)

**Location**: Belandah, Libya
**Period**: December 1942
**Status**: Advanced position end of Q4 1942

As December 1942 progressed, No. 250 Squadron advanced to Belandah 1, maintaining pressure on retreating Axis forces and extending the Desert Air Force's operational reach westward. This continued the pattern of forward deployment that had characterized the squadron's operations throughout November and December.

## Combat Operations (Q4 1942)

### Second Battle of El Alamein: Opening Phase (23 October 1942)

**Date**: 23 October 1942
**Operation**: Operation Lightfoot - Second Battle of El Alamein opening
**Base**: LG 106, Egypt
**Sorties**: 42
**Claims**: 4 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 1 Kittyhawk lost
**Mission Type**: Fighter sweep

The opening of the Second Battle of El Alamein on 23 October 1942 marked the beginning of the most intensive operational period for No. 250 Squadron during Q4 1942. The squadron participated in the massive air offensive that accompanied Montgomery's ground attack, flying multiple sorties throughout the day.

**Mission Profile**:
- Pre-dawn briefing at LG 106
- 0600-0700: First fighter sweeps over battlefield
- Sections of 4 aircraft conducting offensive patrols
- Engagement with German Bf 109s and Italian MC.202 fighters attempting to intercept RAF bombers
- Standing patrols protecting Eighth Army headquarters and supply concentration areas

**Combat Results**:
- 4 enemy aircraft claimed destroyed (likely combination of Bf 109Fs and MC.202 Folgores)
- 1 Kittyhawk lost to enemy action (pilot fate unknown from available sources)
- Successful protection of RAF bomber formations attacking Axis artillery positions

The high sortie count (42 sorties from 14-16 operational aircraft) indicates multiple missions per aircraft, with pilots flying 2-3 sorties during the long October day. This intensive tempo was characteristic of major offensive operations where air superiority was essential to ground force success.

### Second Battle of El Alamein: Exploitation Phase (30 October 1942)

**Date**: 30 October 1942
**Operation**: Second Battle of El Alamein - exploitation phase
**Base**: LG 106, Egypt
**Sorties**: 38
**Claims**: 3 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 2 Kittyhawks lost
**Mission Type**: Ground attack (fighter-bomber operations)

As the Eighth Army's breakthrough developed during the final days of October, No. 250 Squadron transitioned increasingly to ground attack missions. The squadron's Kittyhawks carried 250 lb and 500 lb bombs against Axis supply columns, artillery positions, and vehicle concentrations.

**Ground Attack Tactics**:
1. **Approach**: Fly at altitude (8,000-10,000 ft) to avoid detection and anti-aircraft fire
2. **Target Identification**: Identify target (supply column, vehicle park, artillery position)
3. **Dive**: Enter steep dive to ~1,000-1,500 feet
4. **Bomb Release**: Release bombs at ~1,000 feet
5. **Strafe**: Strafe target with .50 caliber machine guns during pull-out
6. **Escape**: Egress at low level to avoid anti-aircraft fire
7. **Rally**: Reform section and return to base

**Combat Results**:
- 3 enemy aircraft destroyed (likely air-to-air engagements during transit to/from targets)
- 2 Kittyhawks lost to anti-aircraft fire (reflecting hazards of low-level ground attack)
- Significant disruption of Axis supply operations and troop movements

The increased losses (2 aircraft vs. 1 on opening day) reflected the hazards of ground attack operations, where aircraft were exposed to intense anti-aircraft fire from German 20mm Flak guns and Italian machine gun positions. Despite these losses, ground attack missions were essential to exploiting the Eighth Army's breakthrough.

### Second Battle of El Alamein: Pursuit Phase (4 November 1942)

**Date**: 4 November 1942
**Operation**: Second Battle of El Alamein - pursuit operations
**Base**: LG 106, Egypt / Forward landing grounds
**Sorties**: 31
**Claims**: 2 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 0
**Mission Type**: Fighter-bomber (armed reconnaissance and interdiction)

By 4 November, the Axis forces were in full retreat westward. No. 250 Squadron's operations shifted to pursuit missions, attacking retreating columns along the coastal road and conducting armed reconnaissance across the Western Desert to locate and strike targets of opportunity.

**Pursuit Mission Profile**:
- Armed reconnaissance along coastal road (Via Balbia)
- Search for Axis vehicle columns, supply dumps, and troop concentrations
- Interdiction of Axis retreat routes
- Attacks on abandoned equipment and supplies

**Notable Operations**:
- Attacks on Axis columns between Fuka and Mersa Matruh
- Strafing of abandoned vehicles and equipment
- Fighter escort for RAF bombers attacking Axis airfields

**Combat Results**:
- 2 enemy aircraft destroyed (likely opportunistic air-to-air engagements)
- 0 losses - excellent mission execution with no aircraft lost
- Significant contribution to disrupting Axis retreat

The reduced sortie count (31 vs. 42 and 38 earlier) reflected:
- Squadron beginning to advance to forward landing grounds
- Increased distances to worthwhile targets as Axis forces retreated
- Need to conserve aircraft and pilots after intensive October operations
- Some aircraft undergoing maintenance and repair

### Pursuit Operations Into Libya (15 November 1942)

**Date**: 15 November 1942
**Operation**: Pursuit operations west of Egypt into Libya
**Base**: Gambut 1/Gambut 2, Libya
**Sorties**: 26
**Claims**: 1 enemy aircraft destroyed
**Losses**: 1 Kittyhawk lost
**Mission Type**: Ground attack (interdiction and armed reconnaissance)

By mid-November, No. 250 Squadron had advanced deep into Libya, operating from forward landing grounds near Gambut. The squadron continued ground attack operations against retreating Axis forces, though the pace of operations had decreased somewhat from the frenetic tempo of late October.

**Target Types**:
- Motor transport columns retreating along coastal road
- Fuel and ammunition dumps
- Supply depots and logistics facilities
- Abandoned airfields (destroying unserviceable Axis aircraft left behind)
- Axis rear-guard positions covering the retreat

**Operational Challenges**:
- Increasing distance to worthwhile targets (Axis forces falling back toward Benghazi and beyond)
- Aircraft maintenance issues after sustained intensive operations since 23 October
- Weather deterioration (winter rains beginning in Cyrenaica)
- Pilot fatigue after three weeks of intensive combat operations
- Supply line extension from Egyptian rear areas

**Combat Results**:
- 1 enemy aircraft destroyed
- 1 Kittyhawk lost (cause unclear - possibly anti-aircraft fire or mechanical failure)

The reduced sortie rate (26 sorties) reflected the challenges of pursuit operations in the vast Libyan desert and the cumulative fatigue of men and machines after nearly a month of continuous operations.

## Fighter-Bomber Role Evolution

### Transition from Pure Fighter to Fighter-Bomber

By Q4 1942, No. 250 Squadron had fully transitioned to the fighter-bomber role that would characterize its operations for the remainder of the North African campaign. While still capable of air-to-air combat (as evidenced by 10 aerial victories claimed during Q4), the squadron's primary mission had become ground attack in close support of the Eighth Army.

**Factors Driving the Transition**:

**Tactical Developments**:
- Allied air superiority over the battlefield reduced opportunities for air-to-air combat
- Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica fighters increasingly outnumbered and avoided engagement
- Axis air forces focused on defending rear areas rather than contesting battlefield
- Ground forces required continuous close air support to exploit breakthroughs
- Desert terrain favored air interdiction of supply lines

**Technical Factors**:
- P-40/Kittyhawk's rugged construction could withstand ground fire damage
- .50 caliber machine guns highly effective against soft-skinned vehicles and troops
- Bomb-carrying capability (up to 1,000 lbs) provided serious ground attack capability
- Lower-altitude performance advantage suited ground attack role
- External bomb racks and strengthened wing structure enabled fighter-bomber operations

**Operational Considerations**:
- Eighth Army breakthrough required air support to prevent Axis recovery
- Interdiction of Axis supply lines critical to preventing stabilization of front
- Pursuit operations required aircraft capable of rapid advance with ground forces
- RAF bomber force needed fighter-bombers to supplement medium bomber attacks

### Training and Adaptation

The transition to fighter-bomber operations required significant adaptation:

**Pilot Training**:
- Dive-bombing techniques (steep dive, bomb release timing, pull-out procedures)
- Low-level navigation and target identification
- Strafing tactics (approach angles, weapon harmonization, ammunition management)
- Anti-aircraft fire avoidance (jinking, low-level escape maneuvers)
- Coordination with ground forces (radio procedures, target marking, friendly position awareness)

**Ground Crew Adaptation**:
- Bomb loading procedures and safety protocols
- Increased armorer workload (bombs in addition to ammunition)
- Bomb rack maintenance and release mechanism checks
- Fusing procedures (instantaneous vs. delayed-action)
- More frequent inspections due to low-level flight stresses

**Tactical Development**:
- Section and flight tactics for ground attack missions
- Coordination between bomber elements and top cover
- Target prioritization based on Eighth Army requirements
- Battle damage assessment and reporting procedures
- Integration with artillery and ground forces for target identification

### Impact on Combat Effectiveness

The fighter-bomber role had significant implications:

**Advantages**:
- Directly supported ground forces, contributing to battlefield success
- Kittyhawk well-suited to ground attack (rugged, good firepower, adequate speed)
- Flexibility to engage air or ground targets as tactical situation required
- Forward deployment with ground forces ensured responsive air support

**Challenges**:
- Increased losses to anti-aircraft fire (2 of 4 losses during Q4 from ground attack missions)
- Greater pilot fatigue from low-level operations and high stress
- Reduced emphasis on air combat skills and tactics
- Maintenance challenges from low-level flight stresses and battle damage

**Operational Impact**:
- Squadron contributed significantly to Eighth Army's El Alamein victory
- Interdiction operations disrupted Axis retreat and prevented stabilization
- Flexible response to rapidly changing tactical situations during pursuit
- Maintained air superiority while simultaneously attacking ground targets

## Sortie Rate and Operational Tempo

### Sortie Rate: 2.0 Sorties Per Aircraft Per Day

During Q4 1942, No. 250 Squadron maintained an average sortie rate of **2.0 sorties per aircraft per day**, representing a high operational tempo driven by the intensity of the El Alamein battle and subsequent pursuit operations. This rate was sustainable for limited periods during major offensives but placed significant demands on pilots, aircraft, and ground crews.

**Factors Enabling High Sortie Rate**:
- Relatively short-range missions (most targets within 100-150 miles of base)
- Efficient ground crew operations enabling rapid turnaround
- Adequate supply situation (fuel, ammunition, and spare parts)
- Favorable weather conditions (minimal days grounded by weather)
- High pilot morale and motivation during successful offensive operations
- Well-developed procedures for rapid refueling and rearming

**Typical Daily Operations Cycle**:

**First Mission (Dawn Patrol)**:
- 0530: Pilots briefed on targets, friendly positions, weather, enemy activity
- 0545: Pilots man aircraft, preflight checks
- 0600: Aircraft airborne (sections of 4, or flights of 8)
- 0630-0730: Operations over target area (fighter sweep or ground attack)
- 0800: Aircraft recovered at base
- 0800-0830: Refuel, rearm, inspect for damage
- 0830-0900: Pilot debriefing, intelligence reports

**Second Mission (Mid-Day Strike)**:
- 1100: Pilots briefed for second mission
- 1130: Pilots man aircraft
- 1200: Aircraft airborne
- 1230-1330: Operations over target area
- 1400: Aircraft recovered
- 1400-1430: Refuel, rearm, maintenance
- 1430-1500: Pilot debriefing

**Optional Third Mission** (if tactically critical):
- Late afternoon mission during major operations
- Not sustainable for extended periods
- Reserved for critical targets or urgent ground support requests
- Typically smaller sections (4 aircraft vs. full squadron)

### Maintenance Tempo

Sustaining 2.0 sorties per aircraft per day required intense ground crew effort:

**Daily Inspections**:
- Preflight checks before each sortie
- Post-flight inspections for battle damage, wear, leaks
- Daily servicing (oil checks, fuel system checks, control surfaces)

**Preventive Maintenance**:
- Scheduled inspections based on flying hours
- Engine checks and adjustments
- Radio and instrument checks
- Armament system maintenance

**Repair Work**:
- Battle damage repair (bullet holes, damaged skin panels)
- Component replacement (propellers, instruments, hydraulics)
- Engine changes when necessary
- Structural repairs

The ground crew's ability to maintain operational readiness while the squadron repeatedly relocated to forward landing grounds was remarkable, reflecting high skill and dedication.

## Conclusion

No. 250 Squadron RAF during Q4 1942 exemplified the Desert Air Force's successful transition to fighter-bomber operations in support of ground forces. Operating Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk II and Mk III fighters under the command of Squadron Leader Mike Judd, the squadron played an active role in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the subsequent pursuit operations that drove Axis forces from Egypt and Cyrenaica.

The squadron's distinctive "LD" code letters and red arrow marking over exhaust stubs identified its aircraft as they ranged across the Western Desert, striking Axis supply lines, attacking retreating columns, and maintaining air superiority over the battlefield. With 10 aerial victories and 137 documented sorties during the major operations of Q4 1942, the squadron demonstrated both air combat capability and effective ground attack operations.

As part of No. 239 Wing alongside 3 Squadron RAAF and 112 Squadron RAF, No. 250 Squadron contributed to a combined Commonwealth force that provided crucial air support for the Eighth Army's decisive victory. The squadron's extreme mobility - relocating through seven different bases during the quarter - demonstrated the Desert Air Force's ability to advance rapidly with ground forces while maintaining operational effectiveness.

The squadron's combat record during Q4 1942, though perhaps less celebrated than the famous "Shark Squadron" (112 Squadron) or the highest-scoring aces of the desert war, represented the solid, professional performance that characterized RAF fighter operations in North Africa. The Sudan Squadron's transition from pure fighter to fighter-bomber operations reflected the broader evolution of tactical air power during the desert campaign, where control of the skies enabled devastating air-to-ground strikes that complemented artillery and armor in combined arms warfare.

By the end of December 1942, No. 250 Squadron was positioned at Belandah 1, having advanced hundreds of miles westward from its October base at LG 106 in Egypt. The squadron would continue operations into 1943, participating in the final campaigns in Tunisia that would ultimately drive Axis forces from North Africa entirely. The lessons learned during Q4 1942 - fighter-bomber tactics, rapid forward deployment, coordination with ground forces, and maintenance in austere conditions - would inform RAF operations for the remainder of the war.
