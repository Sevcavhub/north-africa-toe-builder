## Historical Context

No. 92 Squadron RAF arrived in Egypt in April 1942 as part of the reinforcement of Allied air power in North Africa. Initially without aircraft, squadron personnel flew operations with No. 80 Squadron's Hawker Hurricanes. The squadron received its own Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vb and Vc aircraft in August 1942, commencing operations from RAF Heliopolis over the El Alamein sector.

By October 1942, the squadron was fully operational and participated in the Second Battle of El Alamein, one of the decisive battles of the North African Campaign. Following the Allied victory, the squadron accompanied the advancing armies as they pursued Axis forces westward across Libya.

## Base Locations

The squadron operated from multiple landing grounds across the Western Desert during Q4 1942:

- **L.G. 173** (4 August - 8 November 1942): Primary operations base during El Alamein
- **L.G. 21** (8-14 November 1942): Brief relocation during pursuit phase
- **Gambut West** (14-24 November 1942): Advanced base following Allied advance
- **Msus** (24 November - 4 December 1942): Operations during westward pursuit
- **El Hassiet** (4-9 December 1942): Temporary base
- **El Nogra** (9-21 December 1942): Late December operations
- **El Merduma** (21 December - 1 January 1943): End of quarter position

These frequent relocations reflect the rapid Allied advance following the El Alamein victory, with the squadron maintaining close air support for ground forces.

## Data Quality Assessment

**Tier Assignment**: **Tier 2 (review_recommended)**
**Confidence**: 70%

### Strengths
- Unit designation confirmed by multiple Tier 2 sources
- Aircraft variants specified with tropical modifications
- Operational timeline well-documented
- Major battles and operations confirmed
- Specific aircraft serial numbers identified
- Notable pilots confirmed with dates

### Limitations
- Squadron commander name unavailable for Q4 1942
- Exact aircraft counts estimated (16 total based on standard RAF establishment)
- Personnel numbers estimated from standard RAF fighter squadron establishment
- Detailed sortie records unavailable
- Combat claims estimated from limited operational records

### Research Notes
The squadron's rapid base relocations during the Allied pursuit following El Alamein made record-keeping challenging. Primary sources for this period remain incomplete in publicly accessible archives. The 70% confidence rating reflects solid confirmation of core facts (unit, aircraft types, operations, locations) with gaps in specific details (exact aircraft counts, commander, detailed combat records).
