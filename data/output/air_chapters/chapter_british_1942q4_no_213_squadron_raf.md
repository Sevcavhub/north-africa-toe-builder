## Bases and Deployment

**October-November 1942:** LG 172 (Landing Ground 172, Egypt)

**November 1942:** LG 20 → LG 101 → El Adem (Libya)

**November-December 1942:** Martuba (Libya)

[SOURCE: historyofwar.org - No. 213 Squadron WWII]

**Note:** The squadron relocated frequently following the Axis retreat after El Alamein, moving from Egyptian bases into captured Libyan airfields. Landing Grounds (LGs) were temporary desert airstrips established by the Desert Air Force for forward operations.

## Combat Operations

### Second Battle of El Alamein (October 23 - November 11, 1942)

No. 213 Squadron participated in air operations supporting the 8th Army's breakthrough at El Alamein. The squadron flew ground attack missions against Axis positions, vehicle columns, and airfields.

**Specific operational details:** Not available in current sources.

[SOURCE: Wikipedia - general participation confirmed, details not provided]

### Operation Chocolate (November 13-16, 1942)

The squadron's most notable operation of Q4 1942 was **Operation Chocolate**, a daring deep penetration raid behind Axis lines during the German-Italian retreat.

**Mission Profile:**
- **Date:** November 13-16, 1942
- **Base:** LG 125 (abandoned Axis airstrip, 140-150 km/miles behind enemy lines, east of Agedabia)
- **Force:** 36 × Hurricanes from 213 and 238 Squadrons
- **Objective:** Harass retreating Axis forces through strafing attacks

**November 14, 1942 - Agedabia Airfield Attack:**

Squadron Leader Olver led 12 × Hurricane IIc aircraft on a strafing mission against Axis airfields around Agedabia.

**Confirmed Victories:**
- Flight Lieutenant Cameron: 1 × Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 destroyed
- Squadron Leader Olver: 3 × Fiat C.R.42 fighters destroyed (one exploded violently, damaging Olver's aircraft)
- Pilot Officer Furneaux & Pilot Officer Smith: 1 × Fiat C.R.42 destroyed (shared)
- Squadron Leader Olver: 1 × Junkers Ju 87 Stuka damaged

**Total Claims:** 5 destroyed, 1 damaged

**Losses:** No aircraft permanently lost, though some landed in the desert and crews spent the night in the open before recovery.

**November 13-15, 1942 - Ground Attack Operations:**

Over three days of operations, 213 and 238 Squadrons destroyed or damaged nearly 300 Axis vehicles (trucks, half-tracks, fuel tankers) during strafing runs along coastal roads.

[SOURCE: Wikipedia, historyofwar.org]

**Withdrawal:** November 16, 1942 - squadrons withdrew before German forces could react to the presence of Allied aircraft operating deep behind their lines.

## Supply and Logistics

**Estimated Supply Status (Q4 1942):**
- Fuel reserves: 5 days (estimated)
- Ammunition reserves: 7 days (estimated)
- Sortie rate: 1-2 sorties per aircraft per day (estimated)
- Operational radius: 650 km with drop tanks (Hurricane IIc specification)
- Overall supply status: Adequate

**Note:** Specific supply data for 213 Squadron not available in current sources. Desert Air Force logistics improved significantly after El Alamein as Allied forces captured Axis supply dumps and airfields, but forward operations like Operation Chocolate operated with minimal logistics support.

**Ordnance Loads (Estimated):**
- 20mm cannon ammunition: ~48,000 rounds (based on 16 aircraft × 4 cannons × 120 rpg × 5 combat loads)
- Cannon shells total: ~9,600 shells
- Aviation fuel: ~25,000 liters (estimated for 5 days operations)

## Historical Context

### Desert Air Force in Q4 1942

The fourth quarter of 1942 marked a turning point in the North African air war. The Desert Air Force achieved air superiority over the Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica during the El Alamein offensive, enabling close air support for the 8th Army's breakthrough.

**No. 243 Wing's Role:**

All four squadrons of 243 Wing (1 SAAF, 33 RAF, 213 RAF, 238 RAF) operated Hurricane IIc fighters in the ground attack role, exploiting the Hurricane's rugged construction and heavy cannon armament for anti-vehicle operations.

**Tactical Evolution:**

By late 1942, the Hurricane was being phased out of air superiority roles in favor of Spitfires and P-40 Warhawks, but remained highly effective as a fighter-bomber. The Hurricane Mk IIc's four 20mm cannons proved devastating against soft-skinned vehicles and light armor.

Some RAF squadrons operated the Hurricane Mk IID with 2 × 40mm anti-tank guns specifically for armored vehicle attacks, but 213 Squadron is confirmed to have operated the IIc variant with 20mm cannons during Q4 1942.
