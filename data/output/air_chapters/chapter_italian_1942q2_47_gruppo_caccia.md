# 47° Gruppo Caccia (later 47° Gruppo BT)
## Research Brief: Historical Discrepancy - NOT Present in North Africa During 1942-Q2

### ⚠️ SEED FILE ERROR IDENTIFIED

**Unit**: 47° Gruppo Caccia (later designated 47° Gruppo BT - Bombardamento Terrestre)
**Nation**: Italian (Regia Aeronautica)
**Parent Formation**: 15° Stormo Assalto
**Claimed Quarter**: 1942-Q2 (April-June 1942)
**Actual First Deployment**: 28 August 1942 (1942-Q3)

---

## Executive Summary

The seed file (`north_africa_seed_units_COMPLETE.json`) incorrectly lists **47° Gruppo Caccia** as present in North Africa during **1942-Q2** (April-June 1942), claiming participation in the Battle of Gazala (May 26 - June 21, 1942).

**Historical evidence conclusively demonstrates** that 47° Gruppo Caccia was **training in Italy** during this period and did not deploy to North Africa until **28 August 1942** - two months after the Battle of Gazala concluded.

**Recommendation**: Remove 47° Gruppo Caccia from 1942-Q2 seed data and add to quarters 1942-Q3 through 1943-Q2 (unit's actual North Africa service period).

## Battle of Gazala Context (1942-Q2)

**Battle Dates**: 26 May - 21 June 1942
**Location**: Gazala Line, Libya
**Quarter**: 1942-Q2

### Italian Air Units Actually Present at Gazala

From 15° Stormo Assalto (same parent formation):
- ✅ **46° Gruppo Caccia** - Confirmed present, based at Benghasi
- ✅ **50° Gruppo Caccia** - Confirmed present, various Libyan bases
- ❌ **47° Gruppo Caccia** - **NOT PRESENT** - Still training in Italy

**Evidence**: No mention of 47° Gruppo Caccia in any Battle of Gazala orders of battle or operational records for May-June 1942. The unit's deployment table shows it was still at Vicenza, Italy during this entire period.

**Reliability**: Tier 2 (specialist military aviation history site with detailed deployment tables)

**Key Evidence**:
1. Complete deployment table showing every base and date from April 1941 through May 1943
2. Clear documentation: **28 August 1942** as first North Africa deployment date
3. Location: Benghasi K.1, Libya (Cyrenaica)

### Cross-Reference Validation

- ✅ 15° Stormo Assalto unit histories confirm 47° Gruppo joining in May 1941 in Italy
- ✅ Battle of Gazala orders of battle (May-June 1942) **do not list** 47° Gruppo Caccia
- ✅ Other 15° Stormo units (46° and 50° Gruppi) documented at Gazala, but **not** 47° Gruppo
- ✅ No Italian Air Force records show 47° Gruppo in North Africa before August 1942

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Remove from 1942-Q2 seed file**
   - 47° Gruppo Caccia was NOT in North Africa during April-June 1942
   - Unit was training in Italy during Battle of Gazala

2. **Add to 1942-Q3 seed file**
   - First deployment: 28 August 1942 at Benghasi K.1
   - This is the correct starting quarter for extraction

3. **Add subsequent quarters**
   - 1942-Q4: Active throughout (El Alamein, withdrawal)
   - 1943-Q1: Tunisia campaign operations
   - 1943-Q2: Final operations until Axis surrender (May 13, 1943)

### Future Extraction Guidance

#### Quarters to Extract (Corrected Timeline)

| Quarter | Status | Operations | Priority |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|
| **1942-Q3** | ✅ SHOULD EXTRACT | First deployment (Aug 28), El Alamein prep | HIGH |
| **1942-Q4** | ✅ SHOULD EXTRACT | Second El Alamein, withdrawal operations | HIGH |
| **1943-Q1** | ✅ SHOULD EXTRACT | Tunisia campaign defensive operations | MEDIUM |
| **1943-Q2** | ✅ SHOULD EXTRACT | Final Tunisia operations, surrender (May 13) | MEDIUM |

#### Related Units to Consider

From same 15° Stormo Assalto:
- **46° Gruppo Caccia** - WAS present at Gazala (1942-Q2) ✅
- **50° Gruppo Caccia** - WAS present at Gazala (1942-Q2) ✅
- **15° Stormo Assalto** - Parent formation (all quarters)
