## Unit Overview

No. 3 Squadron RAAF was one of two Royal Australian Air Force fighter squadrons serving with the Desert Air Force in North Africa during 1942. Alongside No. 450 Squadron RAAF, it formed the Australian contribution to the Commonwealth air effort in the Western Desert Campaign. The fourth quarter of 1942 marked a pivotal period for the squadron, encompassing intense operations during the Second Battle of El Alamein, a critical aircraft re-equipment program, and sustained pursuit operations as the Eighth Army drove Axis forces westward across Libya.

Commanded throughout this period by Squadron Leader Bobby Gibbes—one of the RAAF's most distinguished fighter pilots—the squadron operated from a series of desert landing grounds, transitioning from defensive positions near Alexandria to forward airfields deep in Libya as the tide of war turned decisively in favor of the Allies.

## Command and Leadership

### Squadron Leader Robert Henry Maxwell 'Bobby' Gibbes

Bobby Gibbes assumed command of No. 3 Squadron in February 1942 and would lead the unit until April 1943, making him the squadron's longest-serving commanding officer during World War II. By October 1942, Gibbes had established himself as an exceptional combat leader, combining tactical acumen with personal bravery.

**Combat Record (through 1942q4)**:
- **Aerial Victories**: 10 confirmed enemy aircraft destroyed (would become double ace)
- **Probable Kills**: 5 additional claims
- **Damaged**: 9 enemy aircraft
- **Combat Engagements**: 33 confirmed combats
- **Operational Hours**: 473 hours over two years
- **Sorties**: 224 separate combat missions

Gibbes was noted for his "keen knowledge of tactics, superlative judgment and outstanding leadership." On 28 October 1942, during the height of the El Alamein battle, he claimed what was believed to be the squadron's 200th victory—a Bf 109F—though post-war analysis revised the count to the 175th confirmed kill. Gibbes flew the squadron's only Kittyhawk Mk III during this engagement, demonstrating his willingness to test new equipment in combat.

His leadership during the challenging re-equipment period in November 1942 proved crucial. The transition from Tomahawks to Kittyhawks occurred during active operations, requiring careful coordination to maintain operational capability while pilots and ground crews familiarized themselves with the new aircraft.

A dramatic rescue operation on 21 December 1942 exemplified Gibbes' leadership style. When one of his pilots was shot down by anti-aircraft fire while attacking an enemy airfield, Gibbes landed his damaged Kittyhawk—on one wheel—at their base at Marble Arch, Libya, to bring the pilot home. This action earned him the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

## Aircraft and Equipment

### October - Early November 1942: Curtiss Tomahawk Mk IIB

For the opening weeks of 1942q4, including the critical El Alamein offensive, No. 3 Squadron continued operating the Curtiss Tomahawk Mk IIB (P-40C). The squadron had flown Tomahawks since May 1941, accumulating extensive combat experience with the type.

**Curtiss Tomahawk Mk IIB Specifications**:
- **Engine**: Allison V-1710-33 (1,040 hp)
- **Armament**: 
  - 2× .50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns (nose-mounted)
  - 4× .303-cal (7.7mm) machine guns (wing-mounted)
- **Maximum Speed**: 345 mph (555 km/h) at 15,000 feet
- **Service Ceiling**: 29,000 feet
- **Range**: 730 miles (1,175 km)
- **Combat Radius**: ~300 miles (480 km)

**Combat Performance**:
By late 1942, the Tomahawk was increasingly outclassed by German Bf 109F and Bf 109G variants operating in North Africa. The Tomahawk's relatively weak firepower (especially the rifle-caliber wing guns) and inferior high-altitude performance limited its effectiveness in air-to-air combat. However, the type remained valuable for ground-attack missions and low-level operations where its rugged construction and reliability proved advantageous in the harsh desert environment.

Squadron strength during the El Alamein period: approximately 16 Tomahawks, with 14 typically operational. Standard Desert Air Force fighter squadron establishment called for 16-18 aircraft.

### November-December 1942: Transition to Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk I

In November 1942, No. 3 Squadron received Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk I aircraft (P-40E in USAAF designation), marking a significant capability upgrade. The transition occurred during the pursuit phase following El Alamein, requiring the squadron to balance operational commitments with conversion training.

**Curtiss Kittyhawk Mk IA (P-40E) Specifications**:
- **Engine**: Allison V-1710-39 (1,150 hp) - more powerful than Tomahawk
- **Armament**: 
  - 6× .50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns (all wing-mounted)
  - Underwing shackles for 2× 250-lb or 500-lb bombs
- **Maximum Speed**: 362 mph (580 km/h) at 15,000 feet
- **Service Ceiling**: 29,000 feet
- **Range**: 850 miles (1,368 km) with drop tanks
- **Combat Radius**: ~400 miles (640 km)

**Key Improvements over Tomahawk**:
1. **Firepower**: Six .50-caliber machine guns provided substantially greater hitting power than the Tomahawk's mixed armament
2. **Engine Power**: 110 additional horsepower improved climb rate and combat performance
3. **Ground Attack**: Dedicated bomb shackles enhanced ground-attack capability
4. **Redesigned Airframe**: Improved cockpit visibility, streamlined nose (no protruding guns)

**Operational Notes**:
No. 3 Squadron was accorded a unique honor during this period: it became "the only unit under RAF control that received a long-term supply of Rolls Royce-engined Kittyhawk IIs." While the squadron received Kittyhawk Mk I aircraft in November, subsequent re-equipment with the Packard Merlin-powered Kittyhawk Mk II (P-40F) would follow in 1943, providing even better high-altitude performance.

The Kittyhawk Mk I represented the variant that "bore the brunt of air-to-air combat in early to mid 1942" for RAF and Commonwealth units in North Africa. By late 1942, it remained competitive with Italian fighters and could hold its own against Bf 109F variants in skilled hands, though still outperformed by the latest Bf 109G models.

## Personnel and Organization

**Estimated Squadron Strength (1942q4)**:
- **Pilots**: ~20 (mixture of flight commanders, section leaders, and operational pilots)
- **Ground Crew**: ~90 (fitters, riggers, maintenance personnel)
- **Mechanics**: ~25 (specialized engine and airframe technicians)
- **Armorers**: ~15 (weapons and ordnance specialists)
- **Signals**: ~8 (radio and communications technicians)
- **Total Personnel**: ~158

These figures represent typical RAAF fighter squadron establishment in the Desert Air Force during 1942. The squadron operated as part of No. 239 Wing alongside No. 450 Squadron RAAF and British squadrons Nos. 112 and 250, creating a multi-national fighter formation.

**Notable Pilots**:
- Squadron Leader Bobby Gibbes (CO) - 10 victories by end of 1942
- Flight Lieutenant Andrew 'Nicky' Barr - Top-scoring 3 Squadron pilot during the war
- Various section leaders and experienced pilots who had been with the squadron since 1941

The squadron benefited from continuity in leadership and pilot experience, with many aircrew having served together through the campaigns of 1941-42. This cohesion contributed to tactical effectiveness and unit morale during the intense operations of late 1942.

## Operations and Combat History

### October 1942: El Alamein Defensive Operations

As October began, No. 3 Squadron was based at LG-91 Amriya, approximately 30 kilometers behind the El Alamein defensive line. For four months prior, the squadron had held this position, conducting intensive operations in support of the Eighth Army's defensive stand against Rommel's Afrika Korps.

**Mission Types**:
1. **Fighter Intercept**: Defending against Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica raids on Allied positions
2. **Bomber Escort**: Protecting RAF bombers attacking Axis supply lines and concentrations
3. **Fighter-Bomber**: Ground-attack missions against Axis armor, vehicles, and positions

The squadron flew multiple sorties daily during this period, with individual pilots often completing 2-3 missions per day during peak operations. The demanding tempo strained both personnel and equipment, with serviceability rates sometimes dropping below 80% due to combat damage and the harsh desert environment.

### 23 October - 4 November 1942: Second Battle of El Alamein

The Second Battle of El Alamein commenced on the night of 23 October 1942 with a massive artillery barrage. No. 3 Squadron, along with 450 Squadron RAAF, played a crucial role in the air operations supporting Montgomery's offensive.

**Combined RAAF Operations (3 Sqn + 450 Sqn)**:
- **Duration**: 34-day intensive period
- **Total Sorties**: 1,442 missions flown
- **Losses**: 20 aircraft destroyed, 16 pilots killed

No. 3 Squadron's specific contribution included:
- **23 October**: Opening day operations—38 sorties, 2 enemy aircraft claimed, 1 Tomahawk lost
- **28 October**: Squadron's claimed 200th victory (later revised to 175th)—Gibbes shot down Bf 109F while flying the squadron's only Kittyhawk Mk III
- **Early November**: Breakthrough phase—intensive ground-attack missions against retreating Axis columns

**Tactical Environment**:
The Desert Air Force achieved air superiority during El Alamein, allowing fighter squadrons to focus increasingly on ground-attack missions. No. 3 Squadron's Tomahawks, while less effective in air combat against the latest Axis fighters, proved valuable for strafing and bombing attacks on Axis transport, armor, and defensive positions.

The squadron operated as part of coordinated "Kitty-bomber" attacks, with fighters carrying bombs to supplement dedicated bomber formations. These continuous attacks on Axis transport and airfields contributed significantly to the collapse of Rommel's logistics and eventual retreat.

### November 1942: Pursuit Operations and Re-equipment

Following the breakthrough at El Alamein on 4 November, the Eighth Army pursued Axis forces westward across Libya. No. 3 Squadron followed, operating from a succession of captured airfields:

**Base Movements November 1942**:
- **LG-106** (early November) - Advanced landing ground
- **LG-101** (mid-November) - Forward position
- **LG-76** (mid-November) - Tactical airfield
- **Gambut** (mid-November) - Former Axis airfield near Tobruk
- **Gazala** (late November) - Historic battlefield location
- **Martuba I** (late November-December) - Main operating base

During mid-November, the squadron underwent re-equipment with Kittyhawk Mk I aircraft while maintaining operational commitments. This challenging transition required:
1. Ferrying new aircraft from rear-area depots
2. Pilot conversion training on the new type
3. Ground crew familiarization with different maintenance procedures
4. Continued mission execution with mixed Tomahawk/Kittyhawk strength

The squadron's operational tempo decreased briefly around 15 November during the transition period, with approximately 18 sorties representing primarily familiarization flights and limited combat operations.

### December 1942: Marble Arch and Continued Advance

By December, No. 3 Squadron was fully operational on Kittyhawks and continued supporting the Eighth Army's advance into western Libya. The squadron operated from Martuba I and maintained a detachment at Marble Arch (Alem el Gzina).

**Marble Arch Operations**:
Located deep in Libya, Marble Arch represented a symbolic Axis monument that became a forward operating base for Allied fighters. The location placed the squadron within range of Axis retreat routes and remaining strongpoints.

**21 December Rescue**:
The most notable event of December occurred when Squadron Leader Gibbes rescued a downed pilot. During an attack on an enemy airfield, one of Gibbes' pilots was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Gibbes landed his Kittyhawk—damaged and operating on one wheel—at Marble Arch to recover the pilot, an action that demonstrated both his flying skill and commitment to his men.

**Mission Profile December 1942**:
- **Primary Role**: Ground attack against Axis retreat columns
- **Secondary Role**: Fighter escort for bombers
- **Typical Sortie Rate**: 28+ sorties on active days
- **Combat Environment**: Decreased air-to-air combat as Axis air forces withdrew westward

## Supply and Logistics

### Fuel and Ammunition

**Aviation Fuel**:
- **Reserves**: Approximately 8 days of operational stocks
- **Daily Consumption**: ~2,750 liters (16 aircraft × 2.8 sorties/day × ~60 liters/sortie)
- **Storage**: 22,000 liters in reserves at main base
- **Supply Status**: Adequate, though forward operations occasionally strained logistics

**Ammunition**:
- **.50-caliber rounds**: ~48,000 rounds in stock (sufficient for ~3,000 rounds per gun across fleet)
- **Reserves**: 12 days of operational ammunition
- **Resupply**: Regular convoys from Delta supply depots

**Ordnance** (after Kittyhawk conversion):
- **250-lb GP bombs**: 96 in stock (6 bombs per aircraft × 16 aircraft)
- **500-lb GP bombs**: 48 in stock (alternative loadout)
- **Drop tanks**: 24 external fuel tanks for extended-range missions

### Ground Support Equipment

**Vehicles and Equipment**:
- **Fuel Bowsers**: 4 tanker trucks for refueling operations
- **Bomb Dollies**: 8 ordnance transport carts
- **Trucks**: 18 general transport vehicles for personnel and supplies
- **Staff Cars**: 2 command vehicles
- **Recovery Vehicles**: 1 specialized aircraft salvage vehicle

The squadron's logistics tail was relatively modest compared to ground units, but the frequent base movements during the pursuit phase challenged supply continuity. Ground crews often worked around the clock to prepare aircraft at new airfields while supply trucks caught up with the advancing squadron.

### Supply Challenges

**Desert Environment**:
- Sand ingress requiring frequent engine and armament maintenance
- Extreme temperature variations (cold nights, scorching days)
- Limited water availability for personnel and radiator cooling
- Dust storms disrupting operations and maintenance

**Operational Stress**:
- High sortie rates during El Alamein (2.8+ sorties per aircraft per day)
- Combat damage requiring field repairs
- Spare parts shortages for specialized components
- Rapid base movements complicating logistics chains

Despite these challenges, No. 3 Squadron maintained "adequate" supply status throughout 1942q4, benefiting from improved Allied logistics following El Alamein and the opening of Mediterranean supply routes.
