# No. 45 Squadron RAF - 1941-Q4

## Overview

No. 45 Squadron RAF was a veteran light bomber squadron operating Bristol Blenheim Mk IV aircraft in the Western Desert during the fourth quarter of 1941. Based at multiple forward landing grounds including LG.16, LG.75, Fuka, and Gambut, the squadron provided tactical bombing support during Operation Crusader, the British Eighth Army's major offensive to relieve Tobruk and drive Axis forces from Cyrenaica.

By Q4 1941, No. 45 Squadron had accumulated over a year of continuous combat experience in North Africa since June 1940. Despite operating an increasingly obsolescent aircraft against superior German fighters, and facing severe environmental challenges including waterlogged airfields from November-December rainstorms, the squadron maintained operations throughout the critical Operation Crusader period.

As part of No. 258 Wing within the newly-formed Western Desert Air Force, the squadron flew bombing missions against Axis airfields, supply dumps, ports, and ground installations, contributing to the air superiority campaign that supported the Eighth Army's ground offensive.

### Specifications - Bristol Blenheim Mk IV

**Role**: Light Bomber
**Crew**: 3 (pilot, navigator/bomb-aimer, wireless operator/air gunner)
**Powerplant**: 2 x Bristol Mercury XV radial engines (920 hp each)

**Performance**:
- Max Speed: 266 mph at 11,800 feet
- Cruise Speed: 215 mph
- Range: 1,400 miles (maximum with reduced bomb load)
- Service Ceiling: 22,000 feet
- Operational Radius: 644 km (400 miles with standard bomb load)

**Armament**:
- Offensive: 5 x .303 in Browning machine guns (4 forward-firing in wing pack, 1 in dorsal turret)
- Defensive: 1 x .303 in Vickers K gun in nose position
- Bomb Load: 1,000 lbs normal internal load (typical: 1 x 500 lb + 4 x 250 lb bombs)

### Operational Characteristics

**Strengths**:
- Twin-engine reliability superior to single-engine types
- Capable bomb load for tactical support missions
- Ability to operate from rough forward landing grounds
- Three-man crew providing navigation, bombing, and defensive capabilities

**Weaknesses**:
- By late 1941, "hopelessly outclassed" by German Bf 109 fighters (350+ mph vs 266 mph)
- Inadequate defensive armament (single .303 dorsal turret)
- Light construction and lack of armor made aircraft vulnerable
- Limited service ceiling (22,000 ft) left aircraft vulnerable to high-altitude interception

**Desert Adaptation**:
- Air filters to reduce engine wear from sand ingestion
- Increased inspection intervals for engines and airframes
- Protection of instruments and equipment from dust
- Additional water for engine cooling in high temperatures

### Maintenance Challenges

Desert operations accelerated aircraft wear significantly. Engine overhauls were required more frequently due to sand and dust ingestion. During the November-December 1941 rainstorms that waterlogged forward airfields, No. 45 Squadron was forced to conduct engine overhauls at Gambut under difficult field conditions, with aircraft bogged down in mud and ground crews working in cold, wet weather.

Contemporary photographic evidence shows "A Bristol Blenheim Mark IV of No. 45 Squadron RAF [undergoing] an engine overhaul at waterlogged Gambut, Libya, after violent rainstorms in November and December 1941 rendered many of the forward airfields unusable during Operation CRUSADER."

## Operations

### Operational Summary - 1941-Q4

**Sorties Flown**: Approximately 145 recorded sorties
- Operation Crusader (18 November): 85 sorties
- Operation Crusader continuation (December): 60+ sorties

**Combat Results**:
- Claims: 0 aerial victories (bomber squadron, not fighter)
- Losses: 3 aircraft confirmed lost during quarter

**Mission Types**:
- Bomber support for ground forces (primary mission)
- Airfield attacks against Axis installations
- Port bombing (Tobruk, Benghazi, Derna)
- Supply dump and logistics target strikes

### Notable Operations

#### Operation Crusader (18 November - 30 December 1941)

Operation Crusader was the British Eighth Army's major offensive to relieve the besieged garrison at Tobruk and drive Axis forces out of Cyrenaica. No. 45 Squadron flew intensive bombing operations supporting the ground offensive.

**Target Types**:
- Axis airfields in Cyrenaica (to achieve air superiority)
- Supply dumps and logistics installations
- Ports used for Axis resupply (Tobruk, Benghazi, Derna)
- Ground installations and defensive positions
- Transport columns and supply routes

**Operational Pattern**:
- Missions typically flown in formations of 6-12 aircraft
- Fighter escort provided by Hurricane or Tomahawk squadrons when available
- Attacks from medium altitude (8,000-12,000 feet) balancing accuracy against flak
- Both daylight precision bombing and night operations

**Challenges**:
- Superior German fighter opposition (Bf 109E and F models)
- Waterlogged airfields reducing sortie rates November-December
- Extended supply lines affecting fuel and bomb availability
- Poor weather reducing visibility and navigation accuracy
- Dependence on fighter escort limiting operational flexibility

#### Impact of November-December 1941 Rainstorms

The heavy rainstorms that struck the Western Desert immediately before and during Operation Crusader had dramatic impact on air operations:

- Storm on night of 17/18 November (eve of Operation Crusader) disrupted Axis air operations more than British, contributing to rapid establishment of air superiority
- Subsequent waterlogging of forward landing grounds forced operations from more distant bases
- Field maintenance had to be conducted in mud with aircraft unable to move
- Sortie rates drastically reduced during critical phases of offensive
- Ground crews worked in cold, wet conditions to maintain operational capability

### Supply Status

- **Fuel Reserves**: 10 days of aviation fuel
- **Ammunition**: 8 days of ammunition reserves
- **Operational Radius**: 644 km (400 miles) combat radius
- **Sortie Rate**: 1.5 sorties per aircraft per day (reduced from normal due to weather)
- **Supply Status**: Strained

The squadron's effectiveness depended on the logistical chain supporting operations from Egyptian bases. Each Blenheim IV consumed approximately 60 gallons of fuel per hour. With 12 aircraft flying 1.5 sorties per day averaging 3 hours per sortie, daily fuel consumption reached approximately 3,240 gallons, requiring constant resupply convoys vulnerable to air attack and weather delays.

## Historical Context

### Formation and Early Service

No. 45 Squadron RAF was originally formed on 1 March 1916 during World War I, flying Sopwith Camels on the Western and Italian Fronts. Reformed in April 1921 at RAF Helwan, Egypt, the squadron spent the interwar years in the Middle East, adopting the nickname "The Flying Camels" and receiving its distinctive winged camel badge in October 1936.

### North Africa Combat Record 1940-1941

At the outbreak of World War II, the squadron converted to Bristol Blenheim aircraft and deployed to Egypt. The squadron's North African combat career began on 11 June 1940 with one of the Allies' first attacks on the Regia Aeronautica base at El Adem, destroying or damaging 18 Italian aircraft on the ground.

Throughout 1940-1941, the squadron participated in:
- Western Desert Campaign (June-December 1940) against Italian forces
- East African Campaign (late 1940) with detachment to Gura, Eritrea
- Syria-Lebanon Campaign (June-August 1941) against Vichy French forces
- Return to Western Desert (October 1941) for Operation Crusader

By Q4 1941, the squadron was among the most experienced RAF bomber units in theater.

### The Blenheim's Obsolescence

By December 1941, the Blenheim was widely recognized as obsolete for daylight operations against German fighters. Contemporary assessments noted it was "hopelessly outclassed" by Bf 109 fighters. The RAF recognized the need for more capable bomber types, with American-supplied B-25 Mitchell and A-20 Boston aircraft beginning to arrive in early 1942.

No. 45 Squadron would continue flying Blenheims through mid-1942 before transitioning to new equipment and eventually deploying to the Burma theater.
