## Historical Context

### Pre-Deployment (October - Early November 1942)

At the end of September 1942, No. 152 Squadron received orders to prepare for overseas deployment as part of Operation Torch. The squadron spent October 1942 at RAF Wittering conducting final training and preparation for desert operations. This included:

- Tropical modifications to Spitfire aircraft (dust filters, tropical kits)
- Desert survival training for aircrew
- Modification of ground equipment for North African conditions
- Formation of advance parties and loading of equipment

### Operation Torch Deployment (November 1942)

**Gibraltar Transit (Early November):**
The squadron's aircraft flew to Gibraltar in early November, staging through the Rock before the invasion. Personnel embarked on invasion fleet vessels, sailing with the Allied armada toward North Africa.

**Maison Blanche, Algeria (14 November 1942):**
From 14 November, No. 152 Squadron helped provide air cover for the Allied landings in Algeria. Operating from Maison Blanche airfield near Algiers, the squadron flew defensive patrols and fighter sweeps against limited Luftwaffe and Vichy French opposition.

**Initial Operations:**
- Defensive patrols over Allied beachheads
- Fighter sweeps to establish air superiority
- Escort missions for transport and bomber aircraft
- Few enemy contacts during initial landing phase

### Tunisia Campaign (Late November - December 1942)

**Souk-el-Arba, Tunisia (November-December):**
The squadron advanced eastward, establishing operations at Souk-el-Arba in Tunisia as the First Army pushed toward Tunis. Operating conditions became more challenging:

- Primitive airfield conditions (dirt strips)
- Increased Luftwaffe presence (Bf 109F/G from Sicily)
- Limited ground support infrastructure
- Extended supply lines from Algiers

**Constantine, Algeria (December 1942):**
In December, the squadron moved to Constantine, a more established base in eastern Algeria. This provided:

- Better airfield facilities
- Improved maintenance capabilities
