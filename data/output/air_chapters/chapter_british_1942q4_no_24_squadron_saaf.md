## Operations History - Q4 1942

### Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 4 November 1942)

No. 24 Squadron SAAF participated in the Second Battle of El Alamein as part of No. 3 (S.A.) Wing SAAF.

**Context:**
By the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Desert Air Force fielded **29 squadrons** (including nine South African and three USAAF units). No. 24 Squadron was one of three squadrons in No. 3 (S.A.) Wing:

- No. 12 Squadron SAAF: 24 x Martin Maryland
- No. 21 Squadron SAAF: 24 x Martin Baltimore I/II/III
- **No. 24 Squadron SAAF: 24 x Douglas Boston III**

**Source:** Wikipedia - Desert Air Force, 27 October 1942 Order of Battle (tertiary)

**Operations (Estimated Timeline):**
- **23 October 1942:** El Alamein offensive begins - tactical bombing missions against Axis positions
- **Late October - Early November 1942:** Continued bomber support for Eighth Army breakthrough
- **4 November 1942 onward:** Pursuit operations against retreating Afrika Korps

**Critical Gaps:**
- Specific sortie counts for October-December 1942
- Daily operations and targets
- Aircraft claims (air-to-air, if any)
- Aircraft losses by date
- Individual pilot achievements
- Bomb tonnage delivered

**Required Sources:**
- Christopher Shores - "A History of the Mediterranean Air War 1940-1945, Vol. 2: North African Desert, February 1942 - March 1943" (TIER 1)
- UK National Archives AIR 27 Operations Record Book for No. 24 Squadron SAAF (TIER 1)

### The "Boston Shuttle Service" (Early 1942 Context)

While primarily a Q1-Q2 1942 operation, the "Boston Shuttle Service" represents the squadron's most famous feat:

**Description:**
"The SAAF's single most memorable feat in North Africa in which eighteen aircraft of 12 and 24 Squadrons showered hundreds of tons of bombs on the Afrika Korps during the 'Gazala Gallop' in the first half of 1942."

**Operational Method:**
- Continuous bombing operations with rapid aircraft turnaround
- Multiple sorties per day against enemy positions
- Coordinated with No. 12 Squadron SAAF
- Distinctive "simultaneous take-off manoeuvre" to avoid dust interference

**Source:** samilhistory.com - "The SAAF Boston Shuttle Service" (tertiary, but SAAF-focused history site)

**Note:** This operation predates Q4 1942 but demonstrates squadron capabilities and operational doctrine.
