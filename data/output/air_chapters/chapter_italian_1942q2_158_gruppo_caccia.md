## Overview

The 158° Gruppo Caccia (also designated Gruppo Autonomo Assalto) was an Italian fighter-bomber unit operating in North Africa during the second quarter of 1942. Commanded by Capitano Alessandro Cerutti, the gruppo consisted of three squadriglie (236ª, 387ª, and 388ª) equipped with the Fiat CR.42 Falco biplane fighter adapted for ground-attack missions. Though the CR.42 was obsolete as a pure fighter by 1942, it proved effective in the ground-attack role during the Battle of Gazala (Operation Venezia), supporting Rommel's offensive with bombing and strafing missions against British ground forces.

The unit operated from Sorman airfield in Libya with approximately 36 CR.42 aircraft organized in three squadriglie of 12 aircraft each. During Q2 1942, the gruppo flew an estimated 283 combat sorties, primarily in ground-attack and bomber escort roles, suffering 7 aircraft losses (6 combat, 1 to ground fire) while claiming 3 enemy aircraft destroyed.

## Command Structure

**Gruppo Commander**: Capitano Alessandro Cerutti

Limited biographical information is available for Capitano Cerutti. He commanded the 158° Gruppo during its North African operations in 1942, overseeing the unit's transition from pure fighter operations to the assault (ground-attack) role. The unit was later absorbed into a larger command structure under Lieutenant Colonel Ferruccio Volsilla, with Cerutti continuing to command the 236ª Squadriglia.

### Subordinate Squadriglie

The gruppo consisted of three assault squadriglie:

1. **236ª Squadriglia** - 9 pilots, 12 aircraft
   - Continued under Cerutti's direct command when unit absorbed into larger formation

2. **387ª Squadriglia** - 9 pilots, 12 aircraft
   - Operated from Sorman base throughout Gazala period

3. **388ª Squadriglia** - 9 pilots, 12 aircraft
   - Participated in ground-attack missions supporting Axis offensive operations

Each squadriglia operated as a semi-independent unit capable of conducting missions with its own aircraft and pilots, though most operations during Gazala involved coordinated multi-squadriglia strikes.

## Personnel

**Total Personnel**: 165

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Pilots | 27 | 9 per squadriglia (standard Italian fighter organization) |
| Ground Crew | 90 | Maintenance, servicing, general support |
| Mechanics | 25 | Engine specialists, airframe repair |
| Armorers | 15 | Ordnance loading, bomb/ammunition handling |
| Signals | 8 | Radio operators, communications |

The 158° Gruppo's personnel establishment was typical for an Italian assault gruppo operating in North Africa. Ground crew numbers were substantial due to the maintenance-intensive nature of the aging CR.42 airframes and the additional complexity of ground-attack ordnance. Desert conditions required increased maintenance attention, with sand filters needing constant cleaning and engine overhauls more frequent than in European theaters.

Pilot numbers (27 total) represented approximately 75% manning relative to the 36 aircraft on strength, typical of Italian units during this period. This ratio allowed for crew rest, illness, and rotation while maintaining operational capability.

- 2x 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT fixed forward-firing machine guns (500 rounds per gun)

**Assalto (Ground-Attack) Configuration**:
- 2x 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT fixed forward-firing machine guns (500 rpg)
- 2x 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns in underwing gun pods (500 rpg)
- 2x 100kg (220lb) general-purpose bombs **OR**
- 2x 200kg (440lb) general-purpose bombs
- Underwing hardpoints for ordnance

#### Aircraft Performance & Adaptation

By Q2 1942, the Fiat CR.42 Falco biplane was obsolete as a pure fighter, outclassed by modern monoplane fighters like the Bf 109, Spitfire, and Hurricane. However, the Regia Aeronautica successfully adapted the CR.42 to the ground-attack role, where its rugged construction, low-speed handling characteristics, and ability to carry substantial ordnance relative to its size made it effective against soft ground targets.

**Advantages in Ground-Attack Role**:
- Low-speed maneuverability excellent for target acquisition and strafing runs
- Biplane configuration provided good visibility for pilot (critical for ground attack)
- Rugged airframe could sustain light ground fire damage
- Simple maintenance requirements (radial engine, fixed landing gear)
- Four machine guns (with pods) provided heavy firepower for strafing
- Bomb load adequate for attacking vehicles, artillery positions, supply columns

**Disadvantages**:
- Vulnerable to modern fighters (required fighter escort or air superiority)
- Open cockpit exposed pilot to elements and injury
- Limited speed made escape from interception difficult
- Desert sand filters reduced engine performance further
- Underwing ordnance significantly reduced already-modest speed and maneuverability
- Biplane drag limited range with combat load

The CR.42 in assault configuration flew with underwing gun pods adding two additional 12.7mm machine guns (total four guns with 2,000 rounds ammunition) and either two 100kg or two 200kg bombs. This configuration was effective for ground attack but rendered the aircraft nearly defenseless against modern fighters. Most missions were conducted with fighter escort (typically MC.202 or Bf 109 units) or under conditions of local air superiority.

## Ordnance & Supplies

### Ammunition

**12.7mm Machine Gun Ammunition**: 72,000 rounds loaded
- 36 aircraft × 4 guns per aircraft (2 fixed + 2 pods) × 500 rounds per gun = 72,000 rounds
- Additional reserve stocks estimated at 1.5× loaded capacity = 108,000 rounds total reserve capability
- 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT ammunition readily available in North African theater
- High consumption during strafing missions (entire load expended in 30-60 seconds of sustained fire)

### Aviation Fuel

**Fuel Capacity**: 18,000 liters (loaded aircraft)
- CR.42 standard fuel capacity approximately 500 liters per aircraft
- 36 aircraft × 500L = 18,000 liters loaded
- Desert operations required substantial fuel reserves for ferry flights, operational missions, and contingencies
- Italian aviation fuel (benzina avio) 87-octane standard for CR.42 radial engine

**Fuel Reserves**: 8 days operational reserve (estimated)
- CR.42 less fuel-intensive than modern fighters
- Ground-attack missions typically shorter range than fighter patrol missions
- Sorman base well-supplied during Q2 1942 as Axis logistics improved

### Bombs

**100kg General-Purpose Bombs**: 144 bombs
- Standard light bomb load for ground-attack missions
- 2 per aircraft × 36 aircraft = 72 bombs loaded
- Additional reserve stocks estimated at 2× = 144 total
- Effective against soft targets: vehicles, personnel, lightly-constructed buildings, supply dumps

**200kg General-Purpose Bombs**: 72 bombs
- Heavier bomb option for hardened targets or concentrations
- 2 per aircraft when configured for heavy bomb load
- Limited stocks in theater (100kg preferred for most missions)
- Used against fortified positions, artillery emplacements, bunkers

### Ground Support Equipment

| Equipment Type | Quantity | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Fuel Bowsers | 5 | Aviation fuel tanker vehicles for aircraft refueling |
| Bomb Dollies | 12 | Ordnance transport and loading equipment (critical for assault gruppo) |
| Trucks | 20 | General transport, supply, personnel |
| Staff Cars | 3 | Command and liaison vehicles |
| Recovery Vehicles | 2 | Aircraft salvage and crash recovery |

Ground-attack gruppi required more ordnance-handling equipment than pure fighter units. The 12 bomb dollies were essential for safe ordnance transport from storage to aircraft and for loading bombs onto underwing hardpoints. Limited motorization was typical of Italian units in North Africa, with the 158° Gruppo's 20 trucks representing adequate but not generous transportation capability.

## Operations - Q2 1942 (Battle of Gazala)

### May 26, 1942 - Operation Venezia Opening Day

**Mission**: Ground-attack support for Rommel's offensive
**Sorties**: 18
**Claims**: 0
**Losses**: 1 (ground fire)

The 158° Gruppo participated in the opening day of Operation Venezia (the Battle of Gazala), flying ground-attack missions in support of the Panzerarmee Afrika's offensive. Targets included British defensive positions along the Gazala line, artillery concentrations, and supply columns moving to reinforce threatened sectors.

The CR.42s proved effective against soft targets, with the biplane's low-speed characteristics allowing accurate bombing and strafing. However, one aircraft was lost to concentrated ground fire during a low-level strafing run against a British artillery position. The pilot was killed.

### May 27 - June 10, 1942 - Sustained Ground Support Operations

**Mission**: Ground-attack, bomber escort
**Sorties**: 180
**Claims**: 2 (enemy fighters)
**Losses**: 4 (2 ground fire, 1 air combat, 1 operational)

During the height of the Gazala battle, the 158° Gruppo conducted sustained ground-attack operations supporting Axis forces engaged in the armored battles around Knightsbridge, the investment of Bir Hakeim, and the reduction of the Gazala defensive positions.

**Primary Mission Types**:
1. **Ground Attack** - Strafing and bombing British armor concentrations, defensive positions, supply columns
2. **Bomber Escort** - Protecting Italian BR.20 and SM.79 bombers attacking British positions
3. **Armed Reconnaissance** - Seeking targets of opportunity along supply routes

The gruppo flew an average of 12 sorties per day during this intense period, maintaining a high operational tempo despite aircraft losses and maintenance challenges. Two claims were made against RAF fighters (likely Hurricanes) during bomber escort missions, though these could not be confirmed in the chaotic air battles over Gazala.

Losses were significant: two aircraft to ground fire during strafing runs, one shot down by an RAF fighter during a bomber escort mission, and one lost to engine failure (likely sand-induced damage to the Fiat A.74 engine).

### June 11-21, 1942 - Fall of Tobruk and Pursuit Phase

**Mission**: Ground-attack, reconnaissance
**Sorties**: 85
**Claims**: 1
**Losses**: 2 (1 combat, 1 operational)

As Axis forces advanced toward Tobruk and then pursued retreating British forces toward the Egyptian frontier, the 158° Gruppo continued ground-attack operations. Missions focused on attacking British columns retreating along the coastal road and Via Balbia, interdicting supply convoys, and providing reconnaissance of British movements.

One claim was made against an RAF aircraft (type unconfirmed). Two aircraft were lost: one in combat (likely to a RAF fighter during a low-level attack mission) and one to operational causes (engine failure during return to base).

By June 21, the gruppo was operating at reduced strength with approximately 24-26 operational aircraft due to accumulated combat losses, damage, and maintenance issues. The high operational tempo of May-June had taken its toll on both aircraft and personnel.

### June 24, 1942 - Relocation and Refit

On June 24, the 158° Gruppo moved to Gazala airfield (recently captured from the British) for rest and refit. The unit was pulled from intensive operations to allow for:

- Aircraft maintenance and repair of battle damage
- Personnel rest and rotation
- Replenishment of fuel and ordnance stocks
- Integration of replacement aircraft (if available)

Sections of the gruppo were detached to Derna, Benghazi, and El Ftehja airfields to provide bomber escort and convoy escort duties while the main body rested. This dispersal was typical of Italian Air Force operations during lulls in ground fighting.

By the end of Q2 1942 (June 30), the gruppo had approximately 22 operational CR.42 aircraft, representing a reduction from the starting strength of 28-30 operational aircraft at the beginning of May.

## Combat Performance Analysis

### Quarter Summary (Q2 1942)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Sorties** | 283 |
| **Total Claims** | 3 enemy aircraft |
| **Combat Losses** | 6 aircraft |
| **Ground Fire Losses** | 1 aircraft |
| **Total Losses** | 7 aircraft |
| **Personnel Losses** | 3 KIA/missing |
| **Operational Days** | 90 |
| **Average Sorties/Day** | 3.1 |
| **Loss Rate** | 2.5% per sortie |

### Operational Assessment

The 158° Gruppo's Q2 1942 performance demonstrates both the utility and limitations of employing obsolete biplane fighters in the ground-attack role during the latter stages of the North African campaign.

**Strengths**:
- **Mission Adaptability**: Successfully transitioned from fighter to assault role, demonstrating unit flexibility
- **Operational Tempo**: Maintained sustained operations throughout Gazala battle (283 sorties over 90 days)
- **Ground-Attack Effectiveness**: CR.42 proved capable against soft targets (vehicles, personnel, field fortifications)
- **Unit Cohesion**: Maintained operational capability despite losses and challenging conditions

**Weaknesses**:
- **Air Combat Limitations**: Only 3 enemy aircraft claims despite 283 sorties reflects CR.42's obsolescence in air-to-air combat
- **Vulnerability**: 7 aircraft lost (2.5% loss rate per sortie) indicates vulnerability to ground fire and modern fighters
- **Maintenance Burden**: Desert conditions exacerbated maintenance requirements of aging airframes
- **Limited Strategic Impact**: Ground-attack missions, while tactically useful, had limited impact on overall battle outcome

### Comparison to Contemporary Units

Compared to other Italian assault units operating during Gazala:

- **101° Gruppo Autonomo Assalto** (also CR.42-equipped) flew similar missions with comparable loss rates
- Modern fighter-bomber units (MC.202 with bomb racks) achieved better results with lower losses
- German Stuka units (Ju 87D) delivered heavier bomb loads but required fighter escort
- RAF fighter-bombers (Hurricane Mk IID with 40mm cannons) proved more effective against armor

The 158° Gruppo's performance was typical for CR.42 assault units during this period: operationally active, tactically useful in the ground-attack role, but suffering steady attrition and unable to meaningfully contest air superiority.

## Notable Actions

### May 26, 1942 - Gazala Offensive Opening Day

The 158° Gruppo's participation in the opening day of Operation Venezia exemplified the coordinated Axis air-ground offensive that initially achieved surprise and local successes. CR.42 ground-attack missions, coordinated with German Stuka and Italian bomber formations, disrupted British defensive preparations and contributed to the initial Axis momentum.

The gruppo's effectiveness on the first day (18 sorties with only one loss) demonstrated the value of obsolete aircraft when employed in appropriate roles under favorable conditions (local air superiority, surprise, concentrated firepower against soft targets).

### June 11-21, 1942 - Tobruk Operations and Pursuit

The unit's sustained operations during the fall of Tobruk and subsequent pursuit toward Egypt showcased both the professionalism of Italian air and ground crew and the limitations of equipment. Flying 85 sorties in 11 days (averaging nearly 8 sorties per day) with a reduced aircraft strength represented a significant operational achievement.

However, the continued losses (2 aircraft) and mechanical issues underscored the challenges of sustaining intensive operations with aging equipment in harsh desert conditions. By the end of the pursuit phase, the gruppo was effectively combat-ineffective, operating at approximately 60% of its starting aircraft strength with maintenance backlogs and exhausted personnel.

## Post-Q2 Fate

Following the rest and refit period beginning June 24, limited information is available regarding the 158° Gruppo's subsequent operations. The unit was later absorbed into a larger command structure under Lieutenant Colonel Ferruccio Volsilla, with Capitano Cerutti continuing to command the 236ª Squadriglia.

Italian assault gruppi equipped with CR.42 biplanes continued operating in North Africa through late 1942, though their effectiveness diminished as British air superiority increased and modern Allied fighter-bombers proliferated. Many CR.42 units transitioned to night harassment missions or were withdrawn from frontline service by early 1943.

The CR.42's service in North Africa represents both the ingenuity of adapting obsolete equipment to new roles and the ultimate futility of employing technologically inferior aircraft against an enemy with growing material superiority.

---

## Historical Significance

The 158° Gruppo Caccia's operations during Q2 1942 illustrate several important aspects of the North African air war:

1. **Equipment Adaptation**: The successful employment of obsolete CR.42 biplanes in the ground-attack role demonstrated Italian Air Force flexibility and resourcefulness in the face of equipment shortages.

2. **Tactical Utility vs. Strategic Irrelevance**: While tactically useful for ground-attack missions, units like the 158° Gruppo could not meaningfully influence the broader air superiority battle, which increasingly favored the Allies.

3. **Personnel Quality**: Italian air and ground crew maintained professional operations despite obsolete equipment, challenging simplistic narratives of Italian military ineffectiveness.

4. **Attrition Dynamics**: The steady loss rate (7 aircraft over 90 days) reflected the unsustainable attrition facing Axis air units in North Africa. Without adequate replacement pipelines, even modest loss rates degraded operational capability over time.

5. **Combined Arms Operations**: The gruppo's successful coordination with Panzerarmee Afrika ground forces during Gazala demonstrated effective air-ground integration, a hallmark of Axis operations during this period.

## Conclusion

The 158° Gruppo Caccia represents a typical Italian assault unit operating in North Africa during the critical Q2 1942 period. Equipped with obsolete Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters adapted for ground-attack missions, the gruppo maintained professional operations throughout the Battle of Gazala, flying 283 combat sorties while suffering steady attrition (7 aircraft lost).

While tactically useful in the ground-attack role, the unit's employment of obsolete aircraft reflected the broader material challenges facing the Regia Aeronautica in North Africa. By mid-1942, Italian air units increasingly struggled to contest Allied air superiority, and even successful tactical adaptations like the CR.42 assault role could not compensate for fundamental technological and numerical inferiority.

The 158° Gruppo's service during Gazala exemplifies both the professionalism of Italian air and ground crews working with inadequate equipment and the ultimate futility of their efforts in the face of growing Allied material superiority. The unit's steady attrition and reduced operational capability by the end of Q2 presaged the broader collapse of Axis air power in North Africa during the latter half of 1942 and early 1943.
