- **Role**: Anti-tank ground attack
- **Armament**: 
  - 2× Vickers S 40mm cannons (underwing pods, 15 rounds per gun)
  - 2× .303in Browning machine guns (wing-mounted, loaded with tracers for aiming)
- **Operational Status**: Unknown operational vs. damaged/reserve breakdown

**Hawker Hurricane Mk IIC**
- Temporarily issued December 1942 - February 1943

### Aircraft Specifications

**Hurricane Mk IID "Tank Buster"**:

## Combat Record Summary

### Q4 1942 Claims & Losses

**Confirmed Claims**:
- **24 October 1942**: 16 tanks destroyed (single day record)
- Additional claims throughout October-November not precisely documented

**Total 1942 Record** (April - December):
- 26 tanks destroyed
- 31 armored halftrack troop carriers destroyed
- Numerous other vehicles damaged/destroyed

**Losses**: Specific Q4 losses not documented in available sources. Historical context shows squadron suffered losses to anti-aircraft fire during low-level attacks.

### Operational Challenges

1. **Anti-Aircraft Fire**: Primary threat during low-level tank attacks
2. **Desert Conditions**: Sand, heat affecting aircraft maintenance
3. **Supply Lines**: Fuel and ammunition logistics during rapid advance
4. **Target Acquisition**: Identifying and engaging moving armor

## Squadron History Context

### Pre-Q4 Background

**April 1942**: 
- Re-equipped with Hurricane Mk IID at RAF Shandur, Egypt
- 5 weeks intensive training with captured enemy tanks
- First RAF squadron to specialize in anti-tank role

**June 1942**:
- Moved to RAF Gambut (4 June)
- First combat operation with Hurricane IID (7 June) - unsuccessful
- First tank destroyed (8 June)
- 2 aircraft lost to anti-aircraft fire in early operations

**June-August 1942**:
- By end of August: 26 tanks, 31 armored halftracks destroyed
- Pioneered RAF anti-tank tactics

### Post-Q4 Operations

**February 1943**: 
- Returned to anti-tank role with Hurricane IID
- Continued operations in Tunisia

**March 1943**:
- Heavy losses: 15 Hurricanes shot down (22-26 March)
- Continued operations through end of North African campaign

**September 1943**: 
- Anti-tank role concluded
- Transitioned to other duties

## Tactical Doctrine

### Anti-Tank Attack Profile

1. **Approach**: Low-level ingress to avoid radar detection
2. **Attack Angle**: Shallow dive or level attack from rear quarter
3. **Engagement Range**: 200-400 yards for 40mm cannon effectiveness
4. **Target Priority**: 
   - Tanks (especially Panzer III, Panzer IV)
   - Armored personnel carriers
   - Transport vehicles
   - Supply columns

### Weapon Effectiveness

**40mm Vickers S Cannon**:
- Effective against side/rear armor of most North African tanks
- Limited penetration against frontal armor of Panzer IV
- Best results: rear engine compartment hits
- Ammunition: 15 rounds per gun (30 total)

**Tracer Machine Guns**:
- Used for aiming 40mm cannon
- Pilot aligned tracers, then fired cannons
- No direct anti-armor effect

## Supply & Logistics

Specific supply data not documented in available tier 1/2 sources. Squadron would have required:
- Aviation fuel (100-octane)
- 40mm cannon ammunition
- .303 machine gun ammunition
- Spare parts for Merlin engines
- Ground support equipment

## Historical Significance

### Innovation
- **First RAF Anti-Tank Squadron**: Pioneered specialized ground attack role
- **Tactical Development**: Established procedures for subsequent squadrons
- **Weapon System**: Proved viability of aircraft-mounted 40mm cannon

### El Alamein Contribution
- **24 October 1942**: 16-tank day demonstrated effectiveness
- Supported armor breakthrough during critical phase
- Helped degrade Axis tank strength during battle

### Nickname
**"The Flying Tin Openers"**: Earned during North African campaign for ability to penetrate tank armor with 40mm cannon fire.

## Research Notes

1. **Commander Identity**: Requires access to RAF ORBs or squadron association records
2. **Personnel Strength**: Likely documented in ORBs for this period
3. **Detailed Sorties**: Day-by-day operations in ORBs (National Archives AIR 27 series)
4. **Loss Records**: Combat reports and casualty records needed
5. **Hurricane IIC Period**: December 1942-February 1943 transition deserves further research
