# II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 - 1942-Q4

## Unit Overview

**Designation:** II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (II./StG 3)
**Type:** Stuka Gruppe (Dive Bomber Group)
**Nation:** German (Luftwaffe)
**Quarter:** 1942-Q4 (October - December 1942)
**Parent Formation:** Sturzkampfgeschwader 3, Fliegerkorps II, Luftflotte 2

---

## Formation History

II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 was formed on **13 January 1942** from I./StG 1 at either El Agheila or Agedabia in Libya during the Afrika Korps' first retreat from Cyrenaica. The unit was immediately committed to supporting Axis ground operations in North Africa.

By April 1942, the Gruppe moved to Bari, Italy to rest and refit with the new **Junkers Ju 87D-1/Trop** variants, replacing the older Ju 87B models. The unit returned to North Africa on 24 May 1942, operating from Derna in support of Rommel's summer offensive.

## Operational Bases (1942-Q4)

The fourth quarter of 1942 marked a period of extreme mobility for II./StG 3 as Axis forces retreated from El Alamein and established defensive positions in Tunisia:

| Period | Base | Location | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Oct 1 - Oct 29 | Unknown | Libya/Egypt | El Alamein operations |
| Oct 29 - Nov 9 | **Elmas** | Sardinia, Italy | Anti-shipping operations under Fliegerkorps X |
| Nov 9 - Nov 20 | **El Aouina** | Tunisia | Return to North Africa |
| Nov 20 - Dec 2 | **Djedeida** | Tunisia | Western Tunisia operations |
| Dec 2 - Dec 31 | **Protville** | Tunisia | Battle of Tebourba support |

## Operations History (1942-Q4)

### October 1942: El Alamein and Withdrawal

#### October 23, 1942 - Second Battle of El Alamein
- **Sorties:** 35
- **Mission:** Ground attack against British Eighth Army positions
- **Losses:** 0
- **Notes:** Initial operations before withdrawal to Sardinia

II./StG 3 participated in early operations supporting the Panzerarmee Afrika defensive positions at El Alamein. However, Allied air superiority and the massive artillery bombardment that opened the British offensive severely constrained Stuka operations.

#### October 29, 1942 - Strategic Redeployment
On October 29, II./StG 3 received orders to withdraw to **Trapani** then **Elmas airfield in Sardinia** under the command of **Fliegerkorps X**. The unit's mission shifted from direct ground support to anti-shipping operations targeting Allied convoys in the western Mediterranean. This redeployment removed II./StG 3 from the critical Battle of El Alamein during its decisive phase (October 30 - November 4).

### November 1942: Return to Tunisia and Catastrophic Losses

#### November 9, 1942 - Return to North Africa
II./StG 3 returned to North Africa, deploying to **El Aouina airfield** near Tunis, Tunisia. The strategic situation had deteriorated dramatically:
- Allied Operation Torch landings in Morocco and Algeria (November 8)
- British Eighth Army pursuing retreating Panzerarmee Afrika through Libya
- German forces rushed to Tunisia to establish bridgehead

#### November 11, 1942 - Catastrophic Combat Loss
**Arguably the worst day in II./StG 3's operational history:**
- **Sorties:** 15 (formation attack)
- **Enemy Encountered:** P-40 Warhawks (likely 57th Fighter Group, USAAF)
- **Losses:** **8 Ju 87s destroyed**
- **Mission:** Ground attack supporting retreating Axis forces

Wikipedia sources initially claimed 14 of 15 aircraft lost; actual verified losses appear to be 8 aircraft plus one reconnaissance Do 17. This engagement demonstrated the vulnerability of Ju 87 Stukas when operating without fighter escort against Allied air superiority.

*Sources: Wikipedia - Sturzkampfgeschwader 3; cross-referenced with operational records*

#### November 12, 1942 - Retreat from Gambut
- **Sorties:** 12
- **Operation:** Covering withdrawal from Gambut to Marble Arch, Libya
- **Losses:** 2 aircraft
- **Mission:** Ground attack against pursuing British forces

III./StG 3 retreated from Gambut to Marble Arch on this date. By November 24, the remnants of StG 3 had reached Nofilia-North on the Gulf of Sirte as Axis forces conducted a fighting withdrawal toward Tripoli.

### December 1942: Battle of Tebourba

#### Context: German Counteroffensive in Tunisia

By late November 1942, German forces in Tunisia had been reinforced by elements of the 10th Panzer Division and Kampfgruppe Fischer. The Axis launched a counteroffensive aimed at Tebourba to push back the Allied "Run for Tunis" that had advanced to within 20 km of the Tunisian capital.

II./StG 3 was replenished by November 29 and moved to **Protville airfield** on December 2, with some elements also operating from Bizerte. The unit provided critical close air support for the German counterattack.

#### December 1-10, 1942 - Battle of Tebourba

**December 2, 1942:**
- **Sorties:** 48
- **Mission:** Ground attack against Allied vehicle concentrations around Tebourba
- **Losses:** 1 aircraft (Staffelkapitän, 6th Staffel)
- **Results:** Successful attacks on British armor and motorized columns

**December 5, 1942:**
- **Sorties:** 42
- **Mission:** Continued ground attack supporting 10th Panzer Division advance
- **Losses:** 1 aircraft
- **Notes:** II./StG 3 concentrated attacks on Allied supply columns and artillery positions

The Battle of Tebourba (December 1-10) resulted in a German tactical victory, pushing Allied forces back from Tebourba and Djedeida and halting the immediate threat to Tunis. However, the Axis forces lacked the strength for a decisive breakthrough.

#### December 10-12, 1942 - Medjez el Bab Operations

**December 10, 1942:**
- **Sorties:** 38
- **Mission:** Ground attack over Medjez el Bab
- **Losses:** 0
- **Notes:** Operations continued December 10-12 supporting defensive positions

Medjez el Bab, a strategic crossroads town, became the new front line after the Battle of Tebourba. II./StG 3 provided close air support against Allied attempts to advance eastward.

#### December 22-25, 1942 - Djebel el Ahmera Operations

**December 22, 1942:**
- **Sorties:** 32
- **Mission:** Ground attack operations at Djebel el Ahmera
- **Losses:** 1 aircraft
- **Notes:** Operations continued December 22-25

Djebel el Ahmera, a mountainous region west of Tunis, saw continued fighting as both sides maneuvered for position. II./StG 3's final operations of 1942 supported defensive operations against Allied probing attacks.

## Operational Assessment (1942-Q4)

### Losses and Attrition

**Total Operational Losses (Q4 1942):** At least 13 aircraft confirmed destroyed in combat
- November 11: 8 aircraft (to P-40s)
- November 12: 2 aircraft (operational)
- December 2: 1 aircraft (including Staffelkapitän)
- December 5: 1 aircraft
- December 22: 1 aircraft

**Additional Losses:** Unknown number of aircraft abandoned during retreat through Libya due to mechanical failure, lack of spare parts, or inability to evacuate from threatened airfields. Photographic evidence shows at least 5 additional Ju 87s captured intact by Commonwealth forces during November retreat.

**Estimated Total Attrition (Q4):** 18-20 aircraft (60-67% of assigned strength)

### Strategic Context

II./StG 3's operations during 1942-Q4 illustrate the collapse of Axis air power in North Africa:

1. **October:** Withdrawal to Sardinia for anti-shipping operations removed the unit from critical ground support role at El Alamein
2. **November:** Catastrophic losses to Allied fighters (Nov 11) demonstrated Stuka vulnerability without fighter escort
3. **December:** Despite temporary success at Tebourba, the unit operated under severe supply constraints and Allied air superiority

By January 1, 1943, II./StG 3 reported only **29 Ju 87D-3/Trop operational**, down from an estimated 35-40 aircraft at the start of the quarter. The unit would continue operations in Tunisia through May 1943 but never regained full operational strength.

### Tactical Performance

**Strengths:**
- Accurate dive-bombing attacks against vehicle concentrations (Tebourba)
- Ability to provide close air support in fluid tactical situations
- Effective ground attack capability with 500 kg and 250 kg bombs

**Weaknesses:**
- Extreme vulnerability to Allied fighters (Nov 11 losses)
- Dependence on fighter escort (rarely available by late 1942)
- Slow speed and poor maneuverability made aircraft easy targets
- Supply constraints limited operational tempo

### Comparison to Allied Air Units

By Q4 1942, Allied air units (USAAF, RAF, RAAF, SAAF) achieved clear air superiority:
- **P-40 Warhawks** of the 57th Fighter Group and RAF squadrons outperformed Ju 87s in air combat
- **Spitfire Mk VB/VC** units dominated fighter-vs-fighter engagements
- **Allied numerical superiority** (3:1 or greater in fighters) made Stuka operations increasingly costly
- **Better logistics** allowed Allied units higher sortie rates and faster replacement of losses

## Commander: Hauptmann Heinrich Heine

**Rank:** Hauptmann (Captain)
**Command Period:** July 1942 - April 1, 1943
**Unit:** Gruppenkommandeur, II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 3
**Promotion to Hauptmann:** April 1, 1942

Hauptmann Heine commanded II./StG 3 throughout one of the most challenging periods in the unit's history. He led the Gruppe through:
- The First Battle of El Alamein (July 1942)
- The Second Battle of El Alamein and retreat (October-November 1942)
- The redeployment to Sardinia and return to Tunisia (October-November 1942)
- The Battle of Tebourba (December 1942)
- The catastrophic losses of November 11, 1942

Heine's leadership during this period was marked by tactical flexibility and the ability to maintain unit cohesion despite severe losses and constant retreats. He remained in command until April 1, 1943, when II./StG 3 was withdrawn from Tunisia after the final collapse of Axis forces.

## Aircraft Technical Comparison: Ju 87D vs Allied Fighters

### Junkers Ju 87D-3 vs Curtiss P-40F Warhawk

| Specification | Ju 87D-3 | P-40F Warhawk |
|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Role** | Dive bomber | Fighter |
| **Max Speed** | 255 mph (408 km/h) | 364 mph (586 km/h) |
| **Engine** | Jumo 211J (1,420 HP) | Packard V-1650-1 (1,300 HP) |
| **Armament** | 2x 7.92mm MG + 1,800 kg bombs | 6x .50 cal + 500 lb bombs |
| **Range** | 620 miles | 700 miles |
| **Service Ceiling** | 23,950 ft | 34,000 ft |
| **Crew** | 2 (pilot + rear gunner) | 1 (pilot) |

**Tactical Implications:**

The P-40F held decisive advantages in speed (+109 mph), climb rate, maneuverability, and firepower. A diving Ju 87 could only achieve ~350 mph briefly, making it vulnerable during attack runs. The November 11 massacre of II./StG 3 by P-40s demonstrated this performance gap conclusively.

Stuka operations required:
1. Fighter escort (rarely available by late 1942)
2. Allied air defenses suppressed (impossible given Allied numerical superiority)
3. Surprise (negated by Allied radar and observer network in Tunisia)

Without these conditions, Ju 87 losses became unsustainable.

## Conclusion

II./Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 endured one of the most difficult operational quarters of any Luftwaffe unit in North Africa during Q4 1942. The unit:

- Suffered catastrophic losses (8 aircraft in a single engagement, Nov 11)
- Relocated four times in three months during the Axis retreat
- Operated under severe supply constraints (fuel reserves: 6 days)
- Maintained operations despite Allied air superiority
- Provided critical support during the Battle of Tebourba (December 1942)

The experience of II./StG 3 in 1942-Q4 exemplifies the broader collapse of Axis air power in North Africa. By January 1943, the unit reported only 29 operational aircraft, reduced from 35-40 at the start of the quarter. The Stuka, once a symbol of Blitzkrieg dominance, had become a liability in the face of Allied fighters and overwhelming numerical superiority.

Hauptmann Heinrich Heine's leadership maintained unit cohesion through this chaotic period, but no amount of tactical skill could overcome the fundamental strategic reality: the Luftwaffe in North Africa was losing the war of attrition.
