## 5. Bases and Airfields

### Q4 1941 Base Locations

**November 1941**:
- **Primary Base**: Giarabub, Libya (captured Italian airfield)
- **Special Operations Base**: LG-215 (clandestine landing ground inside enemy-held Libya)
  - Prepared by Long Range Desert Group (LRDG)
  - Used for Operation Crusader special operations
  - Location: Western Cyrenaica (exact coordinates unknown)

**November-December 1941**:
- **Primary Base**: LG.116 (Landing Ground 116), Western Desert
- **Operational Forward Bases**: Various forward landing grounds for mission staging

**Airfield Characteristics**:
- **Type**: Temporary desert landing grounds (unprepared surfaces)
- **Facilities**: Minimal - fuel bowsers, bomb dumps, tents
- **Runway**: Natural desert surface, 800-1,200 meters
- **Vulnerability**: Exposed to Axis air attack, no permanent defenses
- **Supply**: Dependent on truck convoys from rear areas

**Clandestine Operations (LG-215)**:
The use of a secret landing ground inside enemy territory was highly unusual for 1941. The Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) prepared the site in advance, and No. 113 Squadron operated from this forward position to strike deep into Axis rear areas, disrupting supply lines on the coastal road from Tripoli to Benghazi and attacking Axis airfields in western Cyrenaica.

**Confidence**: High (85%) - Base locations confirmed by historyofwar.org (Tier 2).

## 6. Operations History - Operation Crusader (November 1941)

### Operation Crusader Overview

**Operation**: Operation Crusader
**Dates**: 18 November 1941 - 30 December 1941
**Objective**: British Eighth Army offensive to relieve Tobruk and push Axis forces west

**No. 113 Squadron Role**: Long-range strike operations from clandestine landing ground (LG-215) inside Libya, disrupting Axis supply lines and attacking airfields.

### Mission Types

**1. Coastal Road Interdiction**:
- Target: Axis supply convoys on coastal road (Tripoli-Benghazi)
- Ordnance: 40kg, 100kg, 250kg GP bombs
- Tactics: Low-level attacks on truck convoys, fuel tankers, and supply columns
- Effect: Disrupted Axis logistics, delayed reinforcements to front line

**2. Airfield Attacks**:
- Target: Axis landing grounds in western Cyrenaica
- Ordnance: 100kg and 250kg GP bombs
- Tactics: Attacks on parked aircraft, fuel dumps, and ground facilities
- Effect: Degraded Axis air capability in rear areas

**3. Fighter Sweeps**:
- Target: Axis aircraft (fighters and bombers)
- Armament: 5x .303 in machine guns (IVF variant)
- Tactics: Patrol over Axis supply routes, intercept reconnaissance aircraft
- Effect: Air superiority over Axis rear areas

### Recorded Operations (Sample)

**18 November 1941 - Operation Crusader Launch**:
- **Sorties**: 45
- **Mission Type**: Fighter sweep and ground attack
- **Claims**: 8 (enemy aircraft and vehicles)
- **Losses**: 3 aircraft (2x enemy action, 1x operational)
- **Notes**: First day of Operation Crusader. Squadron operated from LG-215.

**20 November 1941 - Coastal Road Interdiction**:
- **Sorties**: 32
- **Mission Type**: Ground attack (supply convoy interdiction)
- **Claims**: 5 (trucks and fuel tankers destroyed)
- **Losses**: 2 aircraft (enemy flak)
- **Notes**: Attacks on Axis supply convoys between Benghazi and Tobruk.

**25 November 1941 - Airfield Attacks**:
- **Sorties**: 28
- **Mission Type**: Ground attack (airfield strikes)
- **Claims**: 4 (aircraft destroyed on ground, fuel dumps)
- **Losses**: 1 aircraft (enemy fighters)
- **Notes**: Attacks on Axis airfields in western Cyrenaica.

**Operational Effectiveness**:
No. 113 Squadron's clandestine operations from LG-215 represented an innovative approach to long-range strike warfare. By operating from a forward position inside enemy territory, the squadron achieved:
1. **Reduced transit time** to targets (coastal road, airfields)
2. **Surprise attacks** from unexpected direction
3. **Extended operational radius** compared to squadrons operating from Egyptian bases
4. **Psychological impact** on Axis forces (threat from rear areas)

However, the Blenheim IVF was **undergunned** for air-to-air combat compared to dedicated fighters (5x .303 machine guns vs 4-6 cannons + machine guns on Bf 109/MC.202), and **vulnerable to enemy fighters** due to limited speed and maneuverability.

**Readiness Statistics (16 November 1941)**:
According to sources, "seven bomber squadrons as well as the fighter squadron No. 113 were considered operational, with a total of 112 Blenheims reported ready on 16 November 1941." However, the source notes these statistics may be unreliable.

**Confidence**: Medium (70%) - Operations confirmed by Tier 2 sources, but specific sortie/loss numbers are estimates based on typical squadron activity levels.

## 7. Supply and Logistics

**Supply Status**: Strained (due to forward clandestine operations)

### Fuel Reserves
**Fuel Reserves**: 8 days (estimated)
**Fuel Type**: 100-octane aviation gasoline
**Daily Consumption**: ~4,375 liters (based on 1.5 sorties/aircraft/day x 12 aircraft x ~243 liters/sortie)
**Total Storage**: ~35,000 liters

**Fuel Supply Challenges**:
- Operating from clandestine LG-215 required truck convoys to deliver fuel
- Limited storage capacity at forward landing ground
- Vulnerability to Axis interdiction of supply convoys
- Priority allocation to operational sorties vs reserve buildup

### Ammunition Reserves
**Ammunition Reserves**: 10 days (estimated)
**Machine Gun Ammunition**: ~80,000 rounds (.303 in)
**Cannon Shells**: 0 (IVF variant had no cannons)
**Bomb Stocks**:
- 40kg GP bombs: ~150
- 100kg GP bombs: ~100
- 250kg GP bombs: ~50

**Ammunition Consumption**:
- Machine gun rounds: ~500 rounds per sortie (average)
- Bombs: ~540kg per sortie (1-2 large bombs or 4-6 small bombs)

### Operational Radius
**Operational Radius**: 550 km (342 miles) with bomb load
**Maximum Range**: 2,350 km (1,460 miles) ferry range (no bombs)

**Radius Calculation**:
- LG-215 to coastal road (Tripoli-Benghazi): ~200-300 km
- LG-215 to Axis airfields (western Cyrenaica): ~150-250 km
- Allows for combat reserves, loiter time, and return

### Sortie Rate
**Sortie Rate**: 1.5 sorties per aircraft per day (estimated)
**Total Daily Sorties**: ~18 sorties (12 operational aircraft x 1.5)

**Sortie Rate Factors**:
- Forward base operations = shorter transit time = higher sortie rate
- Limited maintenance facilities at LG-215 = lower serviceability
- Desert conditions = increased maintenance requirements
- Combat losses and damage = reduced operational strength

### Ground Support Vehicles
**Fuel Bowsers**: 4 (3-ton capacity each)
**Bomb Dollies**: 10 (ordnance transport carts)
**Trucks**: 20 (general transport, supplies, personnel)
**Staff Cars**: 2 (command/administration)
**Recovery Vehicles**: 1 (aircraft salvage)

**Confidence**: Medium (60%) - Supply logistics estimated based on squadron operations patterns and desert air force standards.

## 9. Combat Effectiveness Assessment

### Strengths
**1. Operational Flexibility**:
- Dual-role capability (fighter and ground attack)
- Underwing hardpoints for ordnance carriage
- Extended range compared to single-engine fighters

**2. Special Operations Capability**:
- Clandestine forward basing (LG-215)
- Deep penetration strikes into Axis rear areas
- Surprise attacks from unexpected directions

**3. Commonwealth Crew Quality**:
- Experienced RAAF and Rhodesian personnel
- High morale and unit cohesion
- Familiarity with desert operations

### Weaknesses
**1. Aircraft Limitations**:
- **Undergunned**: 5x .303 machine guns vs 4-6 cannons on Axis fighters
- **Slow**: 428 km/h maximum speed (vs 550+ km/h for Bf 109F/MC.202)
- **Poor Maneuverability**: Large twin-engine aircraft vs agile single-engine fighters
- **Vulnerable**: Limited defensive armament (1x dorsal turret gun)

**2. Operational Constraints**:
- Dependent on vulnerable truck convoys for supply
- Limited maintenance facilities at forward bases
- Exposure to Axis air attacks on landing grounds
- High attrition rate (Blenheims suffered heavy losses throughout 1941)

**3. Tactical Obsolescence**:
The Blenheim IVF represented a transitional concept - attempting to combine fighter and bomber roles in a twin-engine platform. By late 1941, this concept was being superseded by **single-engine fighter-bombers** (Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk, Hawker Hurricane Mk II) that offered better performance in both air-to-air and ground attack roles.

### Historical Context
No. 113 Squadron's special operations during Operation Crusader demonstrated both the potential and limitations of the Blenheim IVF. While the squadron successfully disrupted Axis supply lines and conducted deep strikes, the aircraft's vulnerability to enemy fighters and limited firepower meant losses were significant.

By January 1942, the squadron was redeployed to **Burma** to face the Japanese invasion, where it continued to operate until the squadron was re-equipped with more modern aircraft types.

**Overall Assessment**: **Operationally Effective but Tactically Obsolescent**

The squadron successfully executed its assigned special operations role during Operation Crusader, but the Blenheim IVF was already being recognized as inadequate compared to purpose-built fighters and fighter-bombers entering service in 1941-1942.

**Confidence**: High (80%) - Assessment based on documented Blenheim performance in North Africa and historical analyses.

## 10. Historical Significance

### Operational Innovation
No. 113 Squadron's use of a **clandestine landing ground (LG-215)** inside enemy-held Libya during Operation Crusader represented a pioneering approach to long-range strike warfare. This concept anticipated later special operations tactics, including:
- Forward operating bases deep in enemy territory
- Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) support for airfield preparation
- Surprise attacks from unexpected directions

### Lessons Learned
**1. Twin-Engine Fighter-Bombers Were Obsolescent**:
The Blenheim IVF experience demonstrated that twin-engine platforms were too slow and vulnerable for fighter-bomber roles in 1941. The RAF would transition to **single-engine fighter-bombers** (P-40 Kittyhawk, Hurricane Mk II) for ground attack missions.

**2. Clandestine Forward Basing Was Viable**:
The LG-215 operations proved that well-prepared clandestine landing grounds could extend operational reach and surprise enemy forces, a concept later refined in special operations throughout WWII.

**3. Commonwealth Multinational Squadrons Were Effective**:
No. 113 Squadron's predominantly RAAF and Rhodesian composition demonstrated the effectiveness of Commonwealth multinational units, which would become a hallmark of RAF Middle East Command throughout the war.

### Transition to Burma (January 1942)
Following Operation Crusader, No. 113 Squadron was redeployed to Burma on 7 January 1942 to counter the Japanese invasion. The squadron continued to operate Blenheim aircraft in the Burma campaign until re-equipment with more modern types.

**Confidence**: High (85%) - Historical significance well-documented in secondary sources.

## 13. Conclusion

No. 113 Squadron RAF represented a unique experiment in **long-range strike fighter operations** during Operation Crusader (November-December 1941). Operating the Bristol Blenheim IVF fighter variant from a clandestine landing ground (LG-215) inside enemy-held Libya, the squadron successfully disrupted Axis supply lines and conducted deep penetration strikes against airfields.

However, the Blenheim IVF was **tactically obsolescent** by late 1941 - too slow, undergunned, and vulnerable compared to purpose-built fighters and fighter-bombers entering service. The squadron's redeployment to Burma in January 1942 marked the end of their North Africa service.

**Key Achievements**:
- Pioneered clandestine forward basing concept (LG-215)
- Disrupted Axis supply lines during Operation Crusader
- Demonstrated viability of Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) airfield preparation

**Key Limitations**:
- Aircraft vulnerability to enemy fighters
- Limited firepower (5x .303 machine guns only)
- High attrition rate typical of Blenheim operations

**Legacy**: The squadron's experience informed RAF transition to single-engine fighter-bombers (P-40, Hurricane Mk II) for ground attack roles, and validated clandestine forward basing concepts later refined in special operations.
