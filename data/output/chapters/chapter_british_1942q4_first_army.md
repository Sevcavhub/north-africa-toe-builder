## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Expeditionary field army formed for Operation Torch - amphibious invasion of French North Africa (Algiers sector) and rapid advance into Tunisia to seize Tunis and Bizerta before Axis reinforcement. Mission: Coordinate Allied forces (British, American, French) in Tunisia Campaign.

### Special Capabilities

- Amphibious assault operations (Algiers landings)
- Combined arms integration (armor, infantry, artillery)
- Coalition warfare coordination (British, US, French forces)
- Rapid exploitation (Blade Force 'Run for Tunis')
- Fresh formations with modern equipment

### Tactical Innovations

- Blade Force concept - regimental battlegroup with combined arms
- Coalition command structure integrating British, American, French forces
- Amphibious-to-exploitation rapid transition (landing to armoured advance)
- Adaptation from desert warfare training to Tunisian hill/mud terrain

### Known Issues

- NO COMBAT EXPERIENCE - First Army formed August 1942, first action November 1942
- Extended supply lines (300-400km from Algiers to Tunisia front)
- Insufficient port capacity at Algiers/Bone - logistics bottleneck
- Heavy rains limit tank mobility (mud severely degrades armoured operations)
- Terrain mismatch - trained for desert, fighting in Tunisian hills
- Axis reinforcement via Tunisia/Sicily faster than Allied buildup
- Coalition friction (British-American-French coordination challenges)
- Rushed deployment - advance outpaced logistics and consolidation

**Desert Adaptations:** NOT APPLICABLE - First Army operations in Tunisia/Algeria, NOT Western Desert. Terrain is Mediterranean/European style (hills, farmland, mud) not sand desert. Units trained for desert warfare but operating in completely different environment.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 8/10 |
| **Experience** | Green (first combat operations) |

### Special Rules

- Fresh formations (full strength, high morale, modern equipment)
- Green army penalty (first 3 months combat)
- Blade Force (combined arms mobility bonus)
- Coalition command (coordination penalties with US/French allies)
- Extended supply lines (fuel/ammunition constraints)
- Mud movement penalty (Tunisian rains reduce tank mobility 50%)
- Port capacity bottleneck (logistics delays)

### Scenario Suitability

- Operation Torch (8 November 1942) - Algiers sector landings
- Blade Force 'Run for Tunis' (12-28 November 1942)
- Tunisia Campaign opening battles (November-December 1942)
- Coalition warfare scenarios (British-American-French)
- Amphibious assault operations
- Green army vs veteran opposition
- Logistically constrained offensives

### Historical Engagements

- Operation Torch - Algiers landings (8-9 November 1942)
- Blade Force 'Run for Tunis' (12-28 November 1942)
- Tunisia Campaign opening battles (November-December 1942)
- Battles around Medjez el Bab (November-December 1942)
- Longstop Hill actions (December 1942)

## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Overall Confidence:** 72%

### Primary Sources

- WebSearch: British First Army Operation Torch Tunisia 1942
- WebSearch: Kenneth Anderson First Army commander
- British Military History - Tunisia 1942-1943 Overview and Higher Formations
- Operation Torch order of battle
- Run for Tunis historical sources
- 6th Armoured Division TO&E (data/output/units/british_1942q4_6th_armoured_division_toe.json)
- 78th Infantry Division TO&E (data/output/units/british_1942q4_78th_infantry_division_battleaxe_toe.json)

### Additional Notes

Q4 1942: First Army in TUNISIA/ALGERIA (Operation Torch theater), NOT Western Desert

Formed: August 8, 1942 in UK for Operation Torch planning

First action: Algiers landings (8 November 1942)

Commander: Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson (from formation)

Only 2 British divisions in Q4 1942: 6th Armoured, 78th Infantry (CONFIRMED)

46th Infantry Division NOT in theater Q4 1942 (arrived January 3, 1943)

V Corps operational from November 1942 but file missing - aggregated from divisions

Also coordinated US II Corps and French XIX Corps (not included in aggregates)

Tier 2 classification due to missing V Corps file, unknown Chief of Staff, estimated HQ staff

CRITICAL: V Corps 1942-Q4 missing despite WORK_QUEUE showing complete - data inconsistency

## Conclusion

First Army in 1942 Q4 represents the highest operational formation in this sector. Controlling 5 subordinate formations with combined strength of 31,800 personnel, this army directed major operations in the North Africa theater.
