## Seed File Error

### Current (Incorrect)
```json
{
  "designation": "Littorio Division",
  "quarters": ["1941-Q4", "1942-Q1", "1942-Q2", "1942-Q3", "1942-Q4", "1943-Q1"],
  "battles": ["Gazala", "Tobruk 1942", "El Alamein", "Tunisia"]
}
```

### Should Be (Corrected)
```json
{
  "designation": "Littorio Division",
  "quarters": ["1941-Q4", "1942-Q1", "1942-Q2", "1942-Q3", "1942-Q4"],
  "battles": ["Gazala", "Tobruk 1942", "El Alamein"]
}
```

**Changes Required**:
1. Remove "1943-Q1" from quarters array
2. Remove "Tunisia" from battles array
3. Terminal quarter is 1942-Q4

## Recommendation

**DO NOT** create fictional TO&E data for this non-existent unit. Doing so would violate historical accuracy standards.

**Action Required**: Update `north_africa_seed_units_COMPLETE.json` to reflect the division's destruction in December 1942.
