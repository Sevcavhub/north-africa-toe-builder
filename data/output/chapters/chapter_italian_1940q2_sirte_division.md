# 61Âª Divisione di Fanteria "Sirte" (1940-Q2)

**Nation:** Italian
**Quarter:** 1940-Q2 (April-June 1940)
**Organization Level:** Division
**Type:** Auto-Transportable Infantry Division
**Parent Formation:** XXII Corpo d'Armata (XXII Corps)
**Theater:** North Africa (Libya)

---

## Section 1: Overview

The 61st Infantry Division "Sirte" was a metropolitan Italian infantry division with auto-transportable capability, deployed to Libya for colonial defense duties. During 1940-Q2 (April-June 1940), the division was stationed at Misrata, Libya, and was briefly deployed to the Libya-Tunisia border during Italy's short-lived invasion of France (June 10-24, 1940).

As an "auto-transportable" division, Sirte had partial motorization with 185 trucks capable of moving approximately one-third of the division's personnel at a time. This gave it limited operational mobility compared to fully motorized divisions, but better mobility than standard foot-infantry divisions.

The division was composed of two infantry regiments (69th and 70th "Ancona"), an artillery regiment (43rd "Sirte"), engineer battalion, medical company, and supply section. Total strength was approximately 7,350 personnel.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Metropolitan division (not colonial troops)
- Partial motorization (auto-transportable status)
- Standard Italian infantry weapons and equipment
- Limited anti-tank and anti-aircraft capability
- Adapted to desert conditions through deployment since 1939

---

## Section 2: Historical Context

The Sirte Division was permanently stationed in Libya since 1937 as part of Italy's colonial garrison forces. By 1940-Q2, the division had been in North Africa for three years, giving its personnel significant experience with desert conditions, extreme heat, and the logistical challenges of the Libyan theater.

During June 1940, when Italy declared war on France (June 10), the Sirte Division was deployed from its Misrata garrison to the Libya-Tunisia border to participate in the Italian invasion of French Tunisia. This deployment was brief, lasting only until the Franco-Italian Armistice on June 24, 1940. The division saw minimal combat during this period, serving primarily in a border security and defensive posture role.

After the armistice, Sirte returned to garrison duties at Misrata, where it would remain until the Italian invasion of Egypt in September 1940.

**1940-Q2 Timeline:**
- **April-May:** Garrison duties at Misrata
- **June 10:** Italy declares war on France
- **June 10-24:** Deployed to Libya-Tunisia border (Italian invasion of France)
- **June 24:** Franco-Italian Armistice signed
- **Late June:** Return to Misrata garrison

**Generale di Divisione Vincenzo Della Mura**
- **Rank:** Major General (Generale di Divisione)
- **Appointment Date:** June 10, 1940
- **Service:** Commanded the division from June 1940 until his capture as a prisoner of war on January 23, 1941, during the British capture of Tobruk in Operation Compass.

**Headquarters Location:** Misrata, Libya

**Divisional Staff:**
- **Officers:** 42
- **NCOs:** 85
- **Enlisted:** 178
- **Total HQ Staff:** 305 personnel

**Subordinate Unit Commanders:**
- **69th Infantry Regiment "Ancona":** Commander unknown (not documented in available sources)

## Section 4: Personnel Summary

**Total Personnel:** 7,350

**Breakdown by Rank:**
- **Officers:** 340 (4.6% of total)
- **NCOs:** 1,460 (19.9% of total)
- **Enlisted:** 5,550 (75.5% of total)

- **Notes:** Critical for desert operations but insufficient for extended operations away from water sources

### 7.4 Transportation Assessment

**Mobility:** Auto-Transportable (Partial Motorization)

With 185 trucks for 7,350 personnel, the division could transport approximately 2,500-3,000 men (one-third of strength) in a single lift, assuming 15-20 men per truck. This meant the division could move one regiment or key units rapidly, but required multiple trips to move the entire division.

**Transport Ratio:** 1 truck per 40 men (vs. fully motorized divisions with 1 truck per 10-15 men)

**Operational Radius:** 35km from Misrata supply base (limited by fuel reserves of 4 days)

**Critical Shortages:**
- Insufficient trucks for full divisional mobility
- Limited water tankers (5 tankers inadequate for extended desert operations)
- Fuel reserves limited to 4 days of operations

---

## Section 8: Tanks & Armored Vehicles

**Total Tanks:** 0

The Sirte Division had no organic tank units. Italian infantry divisions in 1940 lacked integrated armored support, which was instead concentrated in specialized armored divisions (Divisioni Corazzate) and tank battalions attached at corps or army level.

**Armored Support:**
Tank support for the Sirte Division would come from corps or army-level tank units when needed for offensive operations. During defensive operations in 1940-Q2, no tank units were attached.

## Section 16: Historical Notes & Context

### 16.1 Formation History

The 61st Infantry Division "Sirte" was formed in 1937 from metropolitan Italian troops and permanently stationed in Libya as part of the colonial garrison. Unlike the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions (composed of native Libyan troops), Sirte was a metropolitan division of Italian nationals.

**Key Historical Milestones:**
- **1937:** Division formed and deployed to Libya
- **1937-1940:** Garrison duties in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica
- **June 1940:** Deployed to Tunisia border (Italian invasion of France)
- **September 1940:** Participated in Italian invasion of Egypt
- **December 1940-January 1941:** Operation Compass (British counteroffensive)
- **January 23, 1941:** Division destroyed, commander captured at Tobruk

### 16.2 Combat Record (Post-1940-Q2)

While the division saw minimal combat during 1940-Q2 (April-June), its subsequent combat record is noteworthy:

**Italian Invasion of Egypt (September 1940):**
Sirte Division participated in the advance into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani. The division occupied defensive positions in the Bardia-Tobruk sector.

**Operation Compass (December 1940-February 1941):**
British and Commonwealth forces launched a counteroffensive that destroyed the Italian 10th Army. The Sirte Division was besieged at Tobruk and annihilated when the fortress fell on January 23, 1941. Divisional commander Generale Della Mura was captured and spent the remainder of the war as a POW.

### 16.3 Tactical Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Well-trained metropolitan troops (not colonial recruits)
- Three years of desert acclimatization (1937-1940)
- Adequate artillery support for defensive operations
- Good internal cohesion and leadership at divisional level

**Weaknesses:**
- Partial motorization limited mobility in desert warfare
- Critically weak anti-tank capability (only 8 guns)
- Outranged by British artillery
- Minimal anti-aircraft protection
- Water and fuel logistics constrained operational radius

**Suitability for Operations:**
- **Defensive Operations:** Good (adequate firepower, prepared positions)
- **Offensive Operations:** Poor (limited mobility, logistics constraints)
- **Mobile Warfare:** Very Poor (insufficient motorization, supply constraints)
- **Desert Warfare:** Adequate (experience and adaptation, but equipment shortcomings)

### 16.4 Comparison to Contemporary Units

**vs. British 7th Armoured Division (1940-Q2):**
- Sirte: 0 tanks, 185 trucks, 35km operational radius
- 7th Armoured: 200+ tanks, 1,500+ vehicles, 150km+ operational radius
- **Verdict:** Sirte completely outmatched in mobility and firepower

**vs. German 5th Light Division (1941-Q1):**
- Sirte: WWI-era artillery, 8 AT guns, partial motorization
- 5th Light: Modern artillery, 100+ AT guns, full motorization, tank support
- **Verdict:** German division vastly superior in all categories

**vs. Other Italian Infantry Divisions (1940):**
- Sirte comparable to Brescia, Pavia, Trento divisions
- Better than Libyan divisions (1st, 2nd Libyan - native troops)
- Inferior to motorized/armored divisions (Ariete, Trieste)

### 16.5 Legacy

The destruction of the Sirte Division at Tobruk in January 1941 was part of the catastrophic defeat of the Italian 10th Army during Operation Compass. The division was never reformed after its destruction, and its number and designation were retired.

The division's combat record illustrates the fundamental inadequacy of Italian infantry divisions for modern mobile warfare in the desert. Partial motorization, weak anti-tank capability, and limited logistics made these divisions vulnerable to the more mobile and better-equipped British forces.

**Lessons from Sirte Division's Experience:**
1. Partial motorization inadequate for desert warfare (full motorization essential)
2. Anti-tank capability must be distributed throughout division (8 guns insufficient)
3. Water and fuel logistics critical (4-day fuel reserves and 5 water tankers inadequate)
4. Modern artillery essential (WWI-era guns outranged and outgunned)
5. Desert acclimatization valuable but cannot compensate for equipment deficiencies
