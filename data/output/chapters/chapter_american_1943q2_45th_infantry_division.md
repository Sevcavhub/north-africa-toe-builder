## 1. Command Structure

**Commanding Officer:**
Major General Troy H. Middleton (appointed August 14, 1942)

General Middleton led the 45th Infantry Division through its combat debut in Tunisia. By Q2 1943, he had transformed a green National Guard division into a combat-effective veteran unit. His WWI experience and methodical leadership style proved invaluable during the division's baptism of fire.

**Assistant Division Commander:**
Brigadier General Raymond S. McLain

**Chief of Staff:**
Colonel William W. Eagles

**Headquarters Location:**
Tunisia (April-May 1943) for final Tunisia Campaign operations
Algeria (June 1943) for Operation Husky (Sicily) preparation and amphibious training

**Staff Composition:**
- Officers: 128

## 17. Additional Context

### Combat Transformation (Q1 to Q2)

The 45th Infantry Division's transformation from January to June 1943 exemplified the American military's rapid learning curve:

**January 1943 (Green Division):**
- No combat experience
- Untested leadership
- Uncertain tactical doctrine
- Desert warfare ignorance

**June 1943 (Veteran Division):**
- 4 months sustained combat
- Battle-tested leadership
- Proven tactical effectiveness
- Desert warfare expertise

This transformation took approximately 120 days of combat operations, training, and adaptation.

### Tunisia Campaign Lessons Learned

**Tactical Lessons:**
1. Artillery coordination critical to infantry success
2. Combined arms (infantry-tank-artillery) essential
3. Night operations capability important
4. Mine warfare requires extensive engineer support
5. Anti-tank defense needs heavier weapons (57mm minimum)

**Operational Lessons:**
1. Logistics planning must account for desert consumption rates
2. Water supply as critical as ammunition
3. Vehicle maintenance requires constant attention in dust/sand
4. Communications discipline prevents enemy intelligence gathering
5. Replacement integration requires systematic approach

**Equipment Lessons:**
1. M1 Garand superior to Axis rifles (confirmed)
2. 37mm AT gun inadequate vs German medium tanks
3. More .50 cal AA needed for Luftwaffe threat
4. Waterproofing critical for amphibious operations
5. Specialized engineer equipment valuable (mine detectors, demolitions)

### Sicily Preparation - June 1943

**Amphibious Training Program:**
The division's June amphibious training was intensive and comprehensive:

**Week 1-2:** Classroom instruction
- Landing craft familiarization
- Naval coordination procedures
- Beach assault tactics
- Sicily intelligence briefings

**Week 3-4:** Practical training
- Ship-to-shore movement practice
- Beach assault rehearsals
- Equipment waterproofing
- Loading/unloading drills

**Week 5-6:** Full rehearsals
- Division-scale landing exercises
- Naval gunfire coordination
- Air support integration
- Medical evacuation practice

### Morale and Unit Identity

**Thunderbird Pride:**
By June 1943, the "Thunderbird" division had earned strong combat reputation:
- Respect from veteran 1st Infantry Division
- Recognition from British allies
- Acknowledgment from German adversaries (POW interrogations)
- Strong media coverage (hometown newspapers)

**National Guard Character:**
The division maintained its National Guard regional identity:
- Oklahoma, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico personnel majority
- State pride and unit cohesion strengthened by combat
- Citizen-soldier ethos balanced with professional military effectiveness
- Regional newspapers following division closely

### Post-Sicily Preview

The division's June 1943 preparation set the stage for distinguished subsequent service:
- **Sicily (July-August 1943):** Successful amphibious assault, combat effectiveness
- **Italy (September 1943-1944):** Salerno, Anzio, Rome campaigns
- **Southern France (August 1944):** Operation Dragoon amphibious assault
- **France-Germany (1944-1945):** Drive into Germany, final victory

The Tunisia-Sicily experience (Q1-Q3 1943) transformed the 45th Infantry Division into one of the US Army's most reliable combat divisions for the remainder of WWII.

## 18. Conclusion

The 45th Infantry Division in 1943 Q2 represented the successful transformation of a National Guard division from green troops to combat-effective veterans. The completion of the Tunisia Campaign (May 13, 1943) validated the division's training, leadership, and combat capabilities. By June 1943, the division was preparing for its next major challenge: the amphibious assault on Sicily.

**Key Achievements (Q2 1943):**
1. **Tunisia Victory:** Contributed to complete Axis defeat in North Africa
2. **Combat Effectiveness:** Proven equal to veteran Regular Army divisions
3. **Casualty Management:** Minimized losses while accomplishing missions
4. **Rapid Learning:** Applied combat lessons to improve tactics and organization
5. **Sicily Preparation:** Successfully trained for complex amphibious assault operation

**Division Character:**
The 45th Infantry Division combined National Guard regional pride with professional military competence. Combat experience strengthened unit cohesion and validated the citizen-soldier concept. The division's artillery excellence, combined arms proficiency, and strong morale made it a valued asset for the Sicily invasion.

**Historical Significance:**
The division's Q2 1943 experience represented the American military's coming-of-age in WWII. Starting as an untested National Guard division in January 1943, by June the 45th had proven itself in sustained combat and was preparing for one of the war's largest amphibious assaults. This transformation demonstrated the US Army's ability to rapidly create combat-effective divisions from citizen-soldiers.

**Looking Ahead:**
The division's June 1943 amphibious training and Sicily preparation set the conditions for success in Operation Husky (July 10, 1943). The combat experience from Tunisia, combined with intensive amphibious training, prepared the Thunderbird division for the challenges of assaulting Fortress Europe through Sicily.

The 45th Infantry Division's Q2 1943 story is one of combat victory, rapid adaptation, and preparation for greater challenges ahead. From the deserts of Tunisia to the beaches of Sicily, the Thunderbird division proved that National Guard soldiers, properly trained and led, could match any division in the US Army.
