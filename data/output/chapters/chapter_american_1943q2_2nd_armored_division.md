**Nation:** American
**Quarter:** 1943-Q2 (April-June 1943)
**Organization Level:** Division
**Type:** Armored Division (Heavy)

---

## Summary

The 2nd Armored Division "Hell on Wheels" spent 1943-Q2 in final preparation for its combat debut as a complete formation. The division moved from Morocco training areas to Algeria (Arzew), then to Tunisia staging areas for Operation Husky (Sicily invasion). Designated as the floating reserve for the Western Task Force, the division completed intensive amphibious training, equipment waterproofing, and ship loading procedures. Command transitioned from Ernest N. Harmon (who took over 1st Armored Division) through brief interim commander Allen F. Kingman, to Major General Hugh J. Gaffey who assumed command May 5, 1943. The quarter involved NO combat operations - purely staging, training, and preparation for the July 10, 1943 Sicily landings at Gela.

## Historical Context

### Geographic Movement (April-June 1943)

**April 1943:**
- Division departed Morocco training areas
- Moved to Algeria, establishing base at Arzew
- Began final equipment preparation for amphibious assault

**May 1943:**
- Continued training at Arzew
- Command transition: Hugh J. Gaffey assumed command May 5
- Moved to Tunisia staging areas (late May)

**June 1943:**
- Marshaling and final preparations in Tunisia
- Tank waterproofing procedures completed
- Ship loading exercises with Navy transport
- Final briefings for Operation Husky

### Command Transition

**Ernest N. Harmon (through April 6, 1943):**
- Led division through Operation Torch and 1943-Q1 training
- Transferred to 1st Armored Division for Tunisia Campaign conclusion
- Brought amphibious training lessons to veteran 1st AD

**Allen F. Kingman (April 6 - May 5, 1943):**
- Brief interim command during transition period
- Maintained training schedule and division readiness
- Limited historical documentation of this period

**Hugh Joseph Gaffey (May 5, 1943 onward):**
- Previously Chief of Staff, Third Army under Patton
- Took command specifically to lead division through Sicily
- Would command division at Gela, Licata, and drive to Palermo
- Benefited from months of amphibious training under Harmon

### Sicily Invasion Planning

**Floating Reserve Concept:**
The 2nd Armored Division was designated as the floating reserve for the Western Task Force (Patton's Seventh Army). This meant:
- Division would be loaded on ships offshore
- Ready to deploy to crisis points as needed
- Could reinforce any landing beach encountering difficulty
- Provided Patton with mobile, powerful reserve force

**Actual Deployment (July 1943):**
- Initially held offshore as reserve
- Landed at Gela July 10-11 to support 1st Infantry Division
- Later elements landed at Licata
- Drive to Palermo with 3rd Infantry Division (July 19 onward)

### Equipment Modernization Complete

**1943-Q2 marked completion of major equipment transitions:**

1. **M3 Lee Phase-Out Complete**
   - 15 M3 Lees in 1943-Q1 → 0 in 1943-Q2
   - All replaced by M4 Sherman variants
   - Division now 100% Sherman for medium tanks

2. **M5 Stuart Standardization**
   - 82 M5 Stuarts (87% of light tank force)
   - M3 Stuart down to 12 tanks (final phase-out)
   - Superior automotive reliability for amphibious operations

3. **Modern Anti-Tank Emphasis**
   - M5 3-inch guns increased to 44 (from 36)
   - Obsolete 37mm guns reduced to 36 (from 42)
   - Better capability vs German armor in Sicily

4. **Anti-Aircraft Enhancement**
   - 40mm Bofors increased to 20 (from 18)
   - Improved air defense for amphibious operations
   - Luftwaffe threat in Sicily theater

## Tactical Doctrine

### Primary Role (1943-Q2)
Floating reserve for Operation Husky (Sicily invasion). Heavy armored division with 18 tank companies providing powerful mobile reserve. Ready to deploy from ships to any crisis point during initial landings. Final preparation and staging - no combat operations during 1943-Q2.

### Special Capabilities

1. **Heavy Division Structure**
   - 18 tank companies (vs. 12 in light divisions)
   - Two full armored regiments (66th and 67th)
   - Superior sustained striking power
   - 286 tanks total (192 medium, 94 light)

2. **Amphibious Assault Capability (Fully Developed)**
   - Six months of intensive training (January-June 1943)
   - Tank waterproofing procedures standardized
   - Ship loading and unloading SOPs established
   - Beach landing coordination with Navy refined
   - Deep wading capability for tanks

3. **Floating Reserve Doctrine**
   - Loaded on transport ships
   - Ready for rapid deployment to any beach
   - Self-contained combat power
   - Can reinforce success or shore up weakness

4. **Combat Command Flexibility**
   - CCA and CCB fully trained and integrated
   - Task organization for specific missions proven
   - Independent operations capability
   - Combined arms coordination excellent

5. **Equipment Modernization Complete**

- Ship loading/unloading procedures
- Beach landing coordination
- Navy fire support integration
- Ship-to-shore communication

**Combined Arms:**
- Tank-infantry coordination
- Artillery forward observer procedures
- Air-ground liaison (for Sicily air support)
- Reconnaissance integration
- Engineer support for beach obstacles

**Command and Control:**
- Combat Command task organization
- Independent operations exercises

- Coordination between Combat Commands
- Division-level maneuver

### Known Issues and Challenges

1. **No Combat Experience as Complete Division**
   - Elements at Beja, Tunisia (1943-Q1) limited
   - Division not tested in sustained operations
   - Training exercises not equivalent to battle
   - Sicily would be true combat test

2. **Command Transition Mid-Quarter**
   - Harmon departed April 6 (experienced commander)
   - Gaffey assumed command May 5 (new to division)
   - One month integration period before Sicily
   - Continuity of training maintained

3. **Heavy Division Complexity**
   - 14,850 personnel (large, complex organization)
   - Command and control challenging
   - Logistically demanding for amphibious operations
   - Ship loading more complex than light divisions

4. **Floating Reserve Uncertainty**
   - Deployment plan flexible (could land anywhere)
   - Units couldn't pre-plan specific objectives
   - Required adaptability and flexibility
   - Communication from ships to shore challenging

5. **Untested in Major Combat**
   - Operation Torch minimal resistance (1942)
   - Tunisia elements limited action (1943-Q1)
   - Sicily would be first major battle
   - German and Italian forces expected to resist strongly

## Supply and Logistics

**Supply Status:** Good - staging and final preparation for Sicily invasion

The division moved from Morocco training areas to Algeria (Arzew), then to Tunisia staging areas during 1943-Q2. Primary activity was final amphibious training, equipment preparation (tank waterproofing), and unit readiness exercises. Supply lines remained secure from Algerian and Tunisian ports. Division designated as floating reserve for Operation Husky, requiring pre-loading of supplies for extended operations from ships. No significant supply constraints. Emphasis on pre-positioning supplies for amphibious assault and initial operations ashore.

**Key Supply Metrics:**
- **Operational Radius:** 270 km (+10 km from improved fuel management)
- **Fuel Reserves:** 8 days (+1 day from 1943-Q1)
- **Ammunition:** 14 days supply (+2 days)
- **Water:** 6.0 liters per person per day (+0.5 liters, summer increase)

**Supply Advantages:**
- Based near excellent Algerian and Tunisian ports
- No combat operations (no losses or consumption)
- Time for thorough depot organization
- Pre-loading for amphibious assault possible
- Maintenance facilities established supply procedures

**Amphibious Supply Preparation:**
- Combat loading procedures (priority items accessible)
- Beach supply dump organization planned
- Mobile supply procedures for rapid inland advance
- Navy logistics coordination (fuel/ammo transfer at sea)
- Pre-packaged unit loads for quick ship-to-shore movement

   - Greater firepower and sustained combat power
   - Complexity and logistical demands continued challenge
   - Sicily would validate or refute heavy division concept

6. **Geographic Repositioning**
   - Morocco → Algeria → Tunisia movement
   - Closer to Sicily invasion staging areas
   - Better port facilities for embarkation
   - Realistic training environment (Mediterranean coastal)

## Next Chapter: Sicily Invasion

**July 10, 1943** - The 2nd Armored Division would land at Gela, Sicily in support of the 1st Infantry Division, marking its combat debut as a complete formation. Elements would later land at Licata and participate in the drive to Palermo. The division's performance would validate six months of intensive amphibious training and prove the effectiveness of the heavy armored division concept in Mediterranean operations.
