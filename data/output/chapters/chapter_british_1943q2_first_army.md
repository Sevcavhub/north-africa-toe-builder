## Corps Overview

**Role:** British First Army primary Allied formation executing final Tunisia offensive (Operations Vulcan and Strike, April-May 1943). Coalition army (British, American, French) under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson operating northern Tunisia sector. Mission: Coordinate multi-national offensive to capture Tunis and Bizerte, envelop Axis forces, and force unconditional surrender ending North Africa campaign. First Army executed coordinated corps-level attacks with massive artillery support, combined arms operations, and methodical reduction of German/Italian defensive positions in restrictive hill terrain. Final offensive 5-13 May 1943 resulted in British entry to Tunis (7 May), US capture of Bizerte, and complete Axis surrender (13 May, 240,000+ POWs). First Army dissolved after Tunisia victory with divisions transferred to Eighth Army for Sicily invasion or withdrawn for rest/refit.

## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** British First Army primary Allied formation executing final Tunisia offensive (Operations Vulcan and Strike, April-May 1943). Coalition army (British, American, French) under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson operating northern Tunisia sector. Mission: Coordinate multi-national offensive to capture Tunis and Bizerte, envelop Axis forces, and force unconditional surrender ending North Africa campaign. First Army executed coordinated corps-level attacks with massive artillery support, combined arms operations, and methodical reduction of German/Italian defensive positions in restrictive hill terrain. Final offensive 5-13 May 1943 resulted in British entry to Tunis (7 May), US capture of Bizerte, and complete Axis surrender (13 May, 240,000+ POWs). First Army dissolved after Tunisia victory with divisions transferred to Eighth Army for Sicily invasion or withdrawn for rest/refit.

### Special Capabilities

- Coalition army command - coordinating British, American, and French forces under single headquarters
- Multi-corps operations - V Corps (infantry), IX Corps (armoured), US II Corps, French XIX Corps
- Massive artillery fires - 600+ guns available for major attacks across First Army front
- Combined arms expertise - infantry, armour, artillery coordination in restrictive terrain
- Mountain/hill warfare adapted from desert warfare - First Army specialized in Tunisia terrain
- Logistics coordination - integrating British, American, and French supply chains
- Set-piece attack planning - methodical operations with overwhelming firepower
- Urban warfare capabilities - Tunis and Bizerte capture operations

### Tactical Innovations

- Coalition army command - Anderson managed British, American, and French formations under single operational headquarters
- Massive multi-corps artillery concentrations - 600+ gun bombardments coordinated across First Army front
- Armoured breakthrough exploitation - IX Corps armoured divisions broke through for Tunis dash (7 May)
- Night operations with rolling barrages - multiple corps executing simultaneous night attacks
- Methodical reduction of defensive positions through overwhelming firepower vs. maneuver
- Coalition logistics coordination - British, American, and French supply systems integrated under First Army
- Corps-level fire support coordination enabling divisional and brigade assaults

### Known Issues

- Coalition friction - British, American, and French operational methods differed
- Anderson's leadership style - perceived as insufficiently aggressive compared to Montgomery
- Extended supply lines from Algerian ports (300-400km) strained logistics during April offensive
- Terrain heavily favored defenders - channelized Allied movement into predictable valleys
- Mixed experience levels - veteran divisions alongside fresh formations learning combat
- US II Corps Kasserine Pass lessons (February 1943) required rebuilding American confidence
- French forces equipment shortages - legacy of 1940 defeat and Vichy period
- Coordination challenges between corps operating in restrictive terrain
- Anderson removed from command after Tunisia victory - not selected for Sicily invasion command (controversial decision)

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 8/10 |
| **Experience** | Mixed - Elite veteran divisions (78th Division), veteran divisions (1st Division), regular fresh divisions (4th Division from UK), mixed American divisions (post-Kasserine rebuilding), French divisions (variable experience) |

### Special Rules

- Anderson Coalition Command: First Army benefits from experienced coalition commander (+1 coordination for multi-national operations, -1 for perceived lack of offensive drive vs. Montgomery)
- Artillery Dominance: British massed fires doctrine (+2 to artillery effectiveness when coordinating army-level fires, 600+ guns available)
- Mixed Experience: 78th Division elite veteran (+1 all rolls), 1st Division veteran, 4th Division regular (fresh from UK), US divisions variable (post-Kasserine recovery), French divisions variable
- Terrain Restrictions: Armour movement severely limited in hill country (-2 mobility for tanks off-road, valleys only)
- Coalition Army: First Army includes British, American, and French forces (coordination challenges -1 first turn each battle, +1 after coordination established)
- Set-Piece Attacks: First Army excels at prepared attacks (+1 planning bonus for attacks with 24+ hours preparation)
- Army Artillery Reserve: May mass fires from 72x 5.5-inch medium guns plus 576x 25-pounders for breakthrough operations
- IX Corps Armoured Breakthrough: IX Corps (1st and 6th Armoured Divisions) may execute exploitation after infantry breakthrough (+2 breakthrough exploitation, -1 in restrictive terrain)
- Axis Surrender: Historical scenario ends 13 May 1943 with Axis surrender (240,000+ POWs, largest surrender since Stalingrad)

### Scenario Suitability

- Operation Vulcan (22 April - 1 May 1943) - First Army offensive northern Tunisia
- Operation Strike (5-13 May 1943) - Final Tunisia offensive with massive artillery support and armoured breakthrough
- Tunis capture (7 May 1943) - British IX Corps armoured dash to capital
- Bizerte capture (7 May 1943) - US II Corps capture of port
- Coalition army command scenarios - coordinating British, American, and French forces
- Multi-corps offensive operations with 4-5 corps under single army headquarters
- Set-piece attacks with overwhelming firepower in restrictive mountain terrain
- Combined infantry-armour operations - V Corps infantry breakthrough enabling IX Corps armoured exploitation
- British First Army vs. Afrika Korps/Italian forces - Tunisia endgame
- Mountain/hill warfare scenarios contrasting with desert warfare
- Army-level artillery coordination and massed fires (600+ guns)
- Coalition friction scenarios - managing multi-national force operational differences

### Historical Engagements

- Operation Torch landings (8 November 1942) - First Army formation and Algeria landings
- Race for Tunis (November-December 1942) - First Army advance to Tunisia frontier (failed to capture Tunis before Axis reinforced)
- Winter stalemate (December 1942-March 1943) - Difficult winter conditions and Axis counterattacks
- Operation Ochsenkopf (26 February - 2 March 1943) - German counterattack vs. V Corps (repulsed)
- Operation Vulcan preliminary attacks (22-28 April 1943) - First Army offensive northern Tunisia sector
- Operation Strike (5-13 May 1943) - Final offensive, massive bombardments, armoured breakthrough
- Tunis capture (7 May 1943) - IX Corps armoured dash to capital (7th Armoured Division entered Tunis)
- Bizerte capture (7 May 1943) - US II Corps capture of port
- Axis surrender Tunisia (13 May 1943) - 240,000+ German and Italian POWs, campaign ends (largest Allied victory to date)
