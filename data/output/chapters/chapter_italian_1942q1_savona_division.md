### Seed File Data Quality Issue

**Problem Identified**: The North Africa seed file (`north_africa_seed_units_COMPLETE.json`) **INCORRECTLY** lists the Savona Division as existing in:

- ‚úÖ 1940-Q3 (correct)
- ‚úÖ 1940-Q4 (correct)
- ‚úÖ 1941-Q1 (correct)
- ‚úÖ 1941-Q2 (correct)
- ‚úÖ 1941-Q3 (correct)
- ‚úÖ 1941-Q4 (correct - destroyed November 1941, during Q4)
- ‚ùå **1942-Q1** (INCORRECT - unit destroyed 2 months prior)
- ‚ùå **1942-Q2** (INCORRECT - unit destroyed 5 months prior)
- ‚ùå **1942-Q3** (INCORRECT - unit destroyed 8 months prior)

### Battle Participation Error

The seed file also lists the Savona Division as participating in:

- ‚úÖ Operation Compass (Dec 1940 - Feb 1941) - CORRECT
- ‚úÖ Operation Crusader (Nov-Dec 1941) - CORRECT (destroyed during this battle)
- ‚ùå **Battle of Gazala (May-Jun 1942)** - **IMPOSSIBLE** (unit destroyed 6 months before Gazala)

### Required Correction

**Action Needed**: Update `north_africa_seed_units_COMPLETE.json`:

1. Remove quarters: `1942-Q1`, `1942-Q2`, `1942-Q3`
2. Remove battle: "Gazala"
3. Add destruction note: "Destroyed during Operation Crusader, November 1941"
4. Add final operational quarter: "1941-Q4" (as last quarter)
