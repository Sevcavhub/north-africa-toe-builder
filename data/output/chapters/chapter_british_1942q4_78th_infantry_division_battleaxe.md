## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Assault infantry division for Operation Torch landings, then rapid advance into Tunisia ('Run for Tunis') to seize Bizerta and Tunis before Axis reinforcement.

### Special Capabilities

- Specially formed as assault division for amphibious operations
- Fresh troops with modern equipment and full strength
- Strong brigade cohesion from training together in Scotland (May-November 1942)
- Guards brigade provides elite infantry core

### Tactical Innovations

- Combined arms amphibious assault training for Torch
- Rapid transition from amphibious landing to sustained advance (Algiers to Tunisia in days)
- Adaptation to Tunisian terrain (very different from expected desert warfare)

### Known Issues

- No organic armor (infantry division)
- No combat experience - first action at Operation Torch
- Extended supply lines during rapid advance
- Unfamiliar terrain - trained for desert, fighting in Tunisian hills/mud
- Heavy rains in November-December limit mobility
- Competition for port capacity with American forces

**Desert Adaptations:** NOT APPLICABLE - Division formed for Operation Torch in Tunisia/Algeria theater. Terrain is Tunisian countryside (hills, farmland, mud) NOT Western Desert sand. Division adapted to Mediterranean/European-style warfare rather than desert conditions.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 8/10 |
| **Experience** | Green (first combat) |

### Special Rules

- Fresh troops bonus (full strength, high morale)
- Modern equipment (6-pounder AT guns, full allocation)
- Guards brigade elite bonus (1st Guards Brigade)
- Amphibious assault training
- Inexperience penalty (first 3 months combat)
- Mud movement penalty (Tunisian rains)

### Scenario Suitability

- Operation Torch (8-9 November 1942) - Algiers landings
- Run for Tunis (14-28 November 1942) - race to seize Tunisia before Axis buildup
- Tunisia Campaign opening battles
- Amphibious assault scenarios
- Fresh division vs veteran opposition

### Historical Engagements

- Operation Torch - Algiers landings (8-9 November 1942)
- Run for Tunis (14-28 November 1942)
- Tunisia Campaign (November 1942 - May 1943)

### Additional Notes

Formed: May 25, 1942 in Scotland specifically for Operation Torch

First action: Algiers landings (8-9 November 1942)

Commander: Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh (from formation)

Nickname: 'Battleaxe Division' (from divisional insignia selected by Evelegh)

Brigade composition: 1st Guards, 11th, 36th Infantry Brigades

Fresh division - no prior combat experience before Torch

Initial landings: 11th and 36th Brigades (9,000 men), 1st Guards in reserve

Terrain: Tunisian hills/farmland with heavy rains, NOT desert

Tier 2 classification due to estimated equipment and missing commander names

Equipment estimated from standard British infantry division war establishment 1942

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
