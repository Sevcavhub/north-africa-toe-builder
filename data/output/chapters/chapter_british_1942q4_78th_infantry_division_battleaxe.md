## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Assault infantry division for Operation Torch landings, then rapid advance into Tunisia ('Run for Tunis') to seize Bizerta and Tunis before Axis reinforcement.

### Special Capabilities

- Specially formed as assault division for amphibious operations
- Fresh troops with modern equipment and full strength
- Strong brigade cohesion from training together in Scotland (May-November 1942)
- Guards brigade provides elite infantry core

### Tactical Innovations

- Combined arms amphibious assault training for Torch
- Rapid transition from amphibious landing to sustained advance (Algiers to Tunisia in days)
- Adaptation to Tunisian terrain (very different from expected desert warfare)

### Known Issues

- No organic armor (infantry division)
- No combat experience - first action at Operation Torch
- Extended supply lines during rapid advance
- Unfamiliar terrain - trained for desert, fighting in Tunisian hills/mud
- Heavy rains in November-December limit mobility
- Competition for port capacity with American forces

**Desert Adaptations:** NOT APPLICABLE - Division formed for Operation Torch in Tunisia/Algeria theater. Terrain is Tunisian countryside (hills, farmland, mud) NOT Western Desert sand. Division adapted to Mediterranean/European-style warfare rather than desert conditions.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

- Run for Tunis (14-28 November 1942) - race to seize Tunisia before Axis buildup
- Tunisia Campaign opening battles
- Amphibious assault scenarios
- Fresh division vs veteran opposition

### Historical Engagements
