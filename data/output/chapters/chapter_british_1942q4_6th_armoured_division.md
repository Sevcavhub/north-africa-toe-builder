## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Armoured division for rapid exploitation during Operation Torch. 'Blade Force' spearheaded advance from Bone/Algiers into Tunisia ('Run for Tunis'). Mission: Seize Tunis and Bizerta before Axis reinforcement.

### Special Capabilities

- Mobile armoured striking force
- Blade Force - combined arms battlegroup (tanks, motorised infantry, artillery, engineers)
- Rapid deployment from Algiers (arrived 12 November)
- Modern tanks (Crusader Mk III, Valentine Mk V) with good mobility

### Tactical Innovations

- Blade Force concept - regimental battlegroup with combined arms (tank regiment + motorised infantry + support)
- Rapid transition from sea landing to armoured advance
- Integration of American light tank battalion into Blade Force
- Paratroops included in mobile battlegroup

### Known Issues

- No combat experience - first action at Operation Torch
- Tunisian mud limits tank mobility (heavy rains November-December)
- Extended supply lines strain fuel/ammunition availability
- Crusader tanks mechanically unreliable in muddy conditions
- Limited infantry support (only 38th Brigade for entire armoured division)
- Rushed deployment - division not fully concentrated before combat

**Desert Adaptations:** PARTIAL - Division trained for desert warfare but deployed to Tunisia. Tunisian terrain (hills, mud, rain) very different from expected desert conditions. Tanks struggle in mud. Division adapting to European-style terrain on the fly.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 8/10 |
| **Experience** | Green (first combat) |

### Special Rules

- Fresh armoured division (full strength, modern tanks)
- Blade Force battlegroup (combined arms mobility bonus)
- Modern Crusader Mk III tanks (good mobility, thin armor)
- Inexperience penalty (first 3 months combat)
- Mud movement penalty (Tunisian rains reduce tank mobility 50%)
- Extended supply lines (fuel/ammo penalties)

### Scenario Suitability

- Operation Torch (8 November 1942) - Bone landings
- Blade Force operations (November-December 1942)
- Run for Tunis (14-28 November 1942)
- Tunisia Campaign opening battles
- Armoured division in difficult terrain scenarios

### Historical Engagements

- Operation Torch - Bone landings (8 November 1942)
- Blade Force advance to Tunisia (12-28 November 1942)
- Run for Tunis (November-December 1942)
- Tunisia Campaign (November 1942 - May 1943)
