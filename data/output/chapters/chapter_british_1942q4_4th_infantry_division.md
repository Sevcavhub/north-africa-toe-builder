## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Infantry division in XIII Corps southern sector at Second Battle of El Alamein. Mission: Support 7th Armoured Division operations, hold defensive positions, prevent Axis breakthrough from southern sector.

### Special Capabilities

- Fresh division with full strength and modern equipment
- Territorial Army units with strong regional cohesion (Home Counties)
- Well-trained in UK before North Africa deployment
- Modern 6-pounder anti-tank guns in good supply

### Tactical Innovations

- Operation Braganza (29-30 September) - night raid by 131st Brigade before main battle
- Adaptation to desert warfare during acclimatization period (June-September 1942)
- Integration with veteran 7th Armoured Division in XIII Corps

### Known Issues

- No organic armor (infantry division)
- First action in North Africa - limited desert warfare experience
- Arrived mid-1942 - only 4-5 months acclimatization before El Alamein
- Territorial Army division adjusting to professional regular army standards
- Climate adjustment challenges (UK to North African desert)

**Desert Adaptations:** Limited desert warfare experience. Division deployed to North Africa May 29, 1942. Underwent desert acclimatization and training June-September 1942. First combat action: Operation Braganza (Sep 29-30) and Second Battle of El Alamein (Oct 23). Still adapting to desert conditions in Q4 1942.
