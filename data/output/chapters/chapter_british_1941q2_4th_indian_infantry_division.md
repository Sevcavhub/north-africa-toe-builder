## Supply & Logistics (Schema v3.1.0)

**Supply Status:** Adequate for defensive operations but constrained for sustained offensive. Division recently returned from East Africa campaign (April 1941) and is reconstituting supplies. Primary constraints: fuel delivery from Egyptian depots (150-250km), ammunition stockpiling for Operation Battleaxe, water resupply in desert conditions. 5th Brigade detached to Syria in June reduces divisional logistics burden.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Operational Radius** | 200 km from main depots |
| **Fuel Reserves** | 8 days at current consumption |
| **Ammunition Stocks** | 12 days of combat operations |
| **Water Requirements** | 85,000 liters per day |
| **Food Rations** | 14 days stockpile |

---

## Weather & Environment (Schema v3.1.0)

**Season:** 1941-Q2 (April-June) - Late Spring to Early Summer

| Environmental Factor | Details |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Temperature Range** | 18°C to 38°C (64°F to 100°F) |
| **Terrain Type** | Coastal plain and rocky desert (Egypt/Cyrenaica border) |
| **Storm Frequency** | ~2 days per month (Khamsin sandstorms) |

**Environmental Notes:** Late spring transitioning to summer. Temperatures rising sharply by June. Khamsin sandstorms common April-May (2-3 days per month). Coastal areas more moderate than inland desert. Division transitioning from East African mountain/highland climate back to desert conditions. Water discipline critical - 5 liters per man per day minimum. Dust and sand affect vehicle maintenance. Limited vegetation for cover in desert terrain.

## Tactical Doctrine

### Role
Experienced British-Indian infantry division with proven combat record in North Africa and East Africa. Specialized in infantry assault operations, defensive positions, and combined arms coordination across diverse terrain including desert, mountain, and urban warfare.

### Special Capabilities
- Combat-proven veteran units from Operation Compass and Battle of Keren
- Mixed British and Indian units providing linguistic and cultural flexibility
- Mountain warfare expertise from East African campaign
- Experienced in combined operations with armoured formations
- Strong esprit de corps and high morale from recent victories

### Tactical Innovations
- Integration of machine gun battalion (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) for sustained fire support
- Flexible brigade organization allowing independent operations
- Combined British-Indian infantry tactics utilizing both formations' strengths
- Experience coordinating with armoured brigades during Operation Battleaxe

### Known Issues
- Division dispersed in Q2 1941 (5th Brigade detached to Syria June 1941)
- No organic light anti-aircraft regiment (added later in 1942)
- Recent return from East Africa may affect equipment readiness
- Limited armoured support (infantry division with no organic tanks)
- Shortage of anti-tank guns despite recent battles highlighting their importance

### Desert Adaptations
4th Indian Division had extensive desert combat experience from Operation Compass (December 1940-February 1941) and ongoing Western Desert operations. Units adapted to desert conditions including water discipline, vehicle maintenance, and navigation. However, recent deployment to East African mountains (March 1941) and subsequent redeployment to desert may have temporarily affected desert-specific readiness.
