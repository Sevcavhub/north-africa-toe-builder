## 2. Historical Context

**Period:** July-September 1942  
**Theater:** North Africa - El Alamein Line

The 9th Australian Division arrived at El Alamein in late June 1942 after garrison duties in Syria. The division immediately entered combat during the First Battle of El Alamein (1-27 July 1942), spearheading offensive operations in the northern coastal sector. The division's most notable achievement was the capture of German signals intelligence Unit 621 on 10 July 1942 during the Tel el Eisa offensive - a major intelligence coup that provided Allied forces with critical insights into German communications.

Throughout August and September 1942, the division held the Tel el Eisa salient, a critical defensive position in the northern sector of the Alamein line. This static defensive role required constant vigilance against Axis counterattacks and aggressive patrolling to maintain the initiative.

**Major Operations in Q3 1942:**
- **Tel el Eisa Offensive (10-27 July):** Captured Tel el Eisa salient and German Unit 621
- **Operation Bacon (22 July):** Combined infantry-armor attack
- **Miteiriya Ridge Defense (August-September):** Static defensive operations
- **Northern Sector Patrols (August-September):** Aggressive night raiding
