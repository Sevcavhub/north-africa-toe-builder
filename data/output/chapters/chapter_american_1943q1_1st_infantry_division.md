### Known Data Gaps

- Exact ammunition stockpile counts (estimated from TO&E)
- Specific attached tank battalion designation (varied by operation)
- Exact casualties by battle (aggregated Q1 1943 figures)
- Equipment variant distributions (standard TO&E assumed)

### Additional Notes

Q1 1943: Division in TUNISIA (Kasserine Pass, El Guettar)

Commander: Major-General Terry de la Mesa Allen (aggressive leader)

Assistant Division Commander: Brigadier-General Theodore Roosevelt Jr.

Major battles: Kasserine Pass (Feb 19-24), El Guettar (Mar 23 - Apr 7)

First US-German engagement: Kasserine Pass (defeat)

Redemption at El Guettar: Repulsed 10th Panzer counterattack

Tier 2 classification due to estimated equipment allocations and TO&E-based counts

Upgraded to schema v3.1.0 for consistency

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
