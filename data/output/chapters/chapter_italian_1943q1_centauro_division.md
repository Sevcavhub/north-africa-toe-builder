### Known Data Gaps

- Chief of Staff name not identified in available primary sources
- Exact battalion-level organization within regiments - requires regimental-level OOB documents
- Precise operational tank counts day-by-day - estimated from standard Italian armored division TO&E reduced for Tunisia campaign attrition
- Individual company designations within regiments - battalion/company level detail not in division-level OOB sources
- Detailed signal and transport equipment inventory beyond standard divisional allocations
- Aircraft allocation - none assigned at division level per US G-2 OOB
