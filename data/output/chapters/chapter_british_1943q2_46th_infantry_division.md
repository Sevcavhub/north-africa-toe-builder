## Section 8: Tactical Doctrine and Employment

### Doctrinal Role Evolution
**Q1 1943:** Defensive operations (Sedjenane, Hunt's Gap)
**Q2 1943:** Offensive operations (Vulcan), final offensive (Strike), training

**Primary Q2 Role:** Transition from defensive to offensive operations, participate in Tunisia victory, prepare for Italy invasion

### Tactical Employment - Q2 1943

**Offensive Operations (April - First Major Offensive)**

Operation Vulcan (22-27 April) represented the division's first major offensive operation, a significant change from Q1 defensive battles.

**Operation Vulcan Tactics:**
1. **Heavy Artillery Bombardment:** Division artillery plus corps/army artillery pounded German positions before assault
2. **Infantry Assault:** Brigades attacked uphill against Hermann Göring Division positions
3. **Objective Seizure:** Captured assigned hills in "heavy fighting"
4. **Clearing Operations:** Took two days to fully clear positions and eliminate resistance
5. **Follow-On:** Intended to create gap for 6th Armoured Division breakthrough

**Tactical Assessment:**
- **Strengths:** Heavy artillery support, determined infantry assault, objectives captured
- **Weaknesses:** Pace too slow (2 days to clear), allowed German anti-tank screen to form, armor breakthrough prevented
- **Lesson:** Offensive operations in hills require speed to exploit success before enemy reacts

**Final Offensive Operations (May - Victorious Conclusion)**

Operation Strike (5-13 May) saw division as part of V Corps in final Tunisia offensive.

**Final Offensive Characteristics:**
1. **Rapid Axis Collapse:** German/Italian resistance crumbling
2. **Multi-Corps Operation:** Coordinated attacks across First Army front
3. **Pursuit Operations:** Following retreating Axis forces
4. **Urban Operations:** Tunis capture (7 May)
5. **POW Operations:** Processing ~250,000 Axis prisoners

### Post-Q2 Summary (Italy Campaign Preview)

**August 1943:**
- Command change: Hawkesworth replaces Freeman-Attwood (25 August)
- Exercise Dryshod (final Salerno rehearsal): Tragic accident, 15 killed

**September 1943:**
- **Operation Avalanche: Salerno invasion (9 September)**
- 46th Division amphibious assault
- Difficult fighting, German counterattacks
- Beachhead held, breakout successful

**1943-1945:**
- **Italy Campaign:** Division fought entire campaign
- One of few divisions Salerno → Victory (May 1945)
- Monte Cassino, Gothic Line, Po Valley
- Distinguished service through war's end

**Q2 1943 Assessment:**
Q2 1943 was the pivotal quarter for the 46th Division - the transition from defensive operations to offensive capability, from North African hill warfare to preparation for Italian coastal assaults, and from combat introduction (Q1) to combat veteran status and victory (Q2). The lessons learned during Operation Vulcan (pace, combined arms, clearing operations) and the morale boost from Tunisia victory prepared the division for the long, difficult Italy Campaign. Freeman-Attwood's leadership through Tunisia established the division's character, while Hawkesworth would lead it through Italy to final victory.

## Section 13: Conclusion

The British 46th Infantry Division's Q2 1943 quarter (April-June 1943) represents the culmination of the Tunisia Campaign and the transition to preparation for the Italy Campaign. This quarter saw the division transform from a defensive-focused formation (Q1 1943) into a combat-veteran division capable of offensive operations, though with a learning curve evident in Operation Vulcan's execution.

**April 1943** marked the division's first major offensive operation - Operation Vulcan (22-27 April) - attacking the elite Hermann Göring Division in the hills northeast of Bou Arada. After heavy artillery bombardment, the division's three brigades assaulted uphill against prepared German positions in "heavy fighting" that lasted five days. While the division successfully captured its objectives, the pace was too slow - taking two days to fully clear positions instead of one - which allowed the Germans to form an anti-tank screen that prevented the intended breakthrough by the 6th Armoured Division. This operational experience taught crucial lessons about offensive tempo, combined arms coordination, and the need for rapid exploitation of success before the enemy can react.

**May 1943** saw the division participate in the final Tunisia offensive - Operation Strike (5-13 May) - after being transferred from IX Corps to V Corps on 1 May. As part of the multi-corps Allied attack that broke Axis resistance, the division witnessed and contributed to the rapid collapse of German and Italian forces. On 7 May, Tunis fell to British forces (and Bizerte to American forces), and by 13 May the entire Axis force in Tunisia - approximately 250,000 prisoners of war, the largest surrender since Stalingrad - had capitulated. On 20 May, elements of the 46th Division participated in the victory parade in Tunis, a symbolic recognition of the division's 4.5 months of continuous combat operations (3 January - 13 May 1943) in the Tunisia Campaign.

**June 1943** marked a complete transition from combat to training as the division prepared for the next phase of the war. Rather than participating in Operation Husky (the Sicily invasion in July), the division was held in Tunisia for amphibious assault training. Exercise Conqueror saw the 46th Division defending against an American amphibious landing, providing valuable training from the defender's perspective that would inform their understanding of amphibious operations. This training was in preparation for Operation Buttress (a proposed Strait of Messina crossing) which was later cancelled, leading to the division's reassignment to Operation Avalanche - the Salerno landings in September 1943.

Under Major-General Harold Freeman-Attwood's continued command (his final months before replacement by Major-General John Hawkesworth on 25 August 1943), the division successfully navigated the challenges of Q2 1943. Estimated casualties of 300-600 personnel (primarily from Operation Vulcan's heavy fighting) were sustainable and did not significantly degrade combat effectiveness. The division's Territorial Army structure - with its regional identity in the Hampshire and Sherwood Foresters brigades - maintained morale and cohesion through the transition from defensive to offensive operations.

The 46th Division's Q2 1943 experience exemplifies the British First Army's path through the final phase of the North African campaign: transitioning from defensive operations to offensive capability, achieving decisive victory, and then preparing for the next operational challenge. The lessons learned during Operation Vulcan about offensive pace and combined arms integration, combined with the morale boost from Tunisia's victorious conclusion, prepared the division for the long and difficult Italy Campaign that would follow. The division that landed at Salerno in September 1943 was a far more capable formation than the green division that had arrived in Tunisia in January - tempered by defensive battles, taught by offensive operations, and emboldened by victory.

Q2 1943 was not the division's most dramatic quarter (Q1's Sedjenane and Hunt's Gap battles were more intense), nor its most costly in casualties (Italy Campaign would exceed Tunisia losses many times over), but it was the pivotal quarter that transformed the 46th Infantry Division from a defensive force learning its trade into a combat-veteran division ready for the challenges of amphibious assault and the grinding campaign up the Italian peninsula.
