## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Colonial infantry division with Italian officers and Libyan NCOs/troops. Designed for static defense of fortified camps in Egyptian Western Desert. Part of Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940) and defensive operations at Sidi Barrani.

### Special Capabilities

- Libyan paratroop battalion 'Fanti dell'Aria' (elite airborne unit)
- Adapted to desert conditions (Libyan troops native to region)
- Fortified camp defense tactics

### Known Issues

- ⚠️ ISOLATED POSITION: Maktila camp 22 miles from other Italian positions
- ⚠️ UNABLE TO SUPPORT OTHER UNITS: Distance prevented mutual support with 2nd Libyan Division at Tummar
- Inferior equipment compared to regular Italian divisions (77/28 vs 75/27 guns)
- Colonial troops lower training standard than metropolitan Italian troops
- Poor coordination between infantry groups during British attack
- Sandstorm on December 10 disrupted visibility and communications
- Rapid collapse after initial resistance - morale broke quickly

**Desert Adaptations:** Libyan troops well-adapted to desert conditions (native to region). Division trained for static defense of fortified camps rather than mobile operations.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 5/10 |
| **Experience** | Regular |

### Special Rules

- Colonial Division: -1 to training, +1 to desert terrain
- Isolated Position: Cannot receive support from other Italian units at Maktila
- Fortified Camp: +2 to defense when in prepared positions
- Division Destroyed (Dec 11, 1940): Unit ceases to exist after this date
- Sandstorm Penalty: -2 to visibility and coordination on December 10, 1940

### Scenario Suitability

- Operation Compass - Battle of Maktila (December 10-11, 1940)
- Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940) - capture of Sollum
- Static defense of fortified camps scenario
- Colonial division vs British armored/infantry combined arms

### Historical Engagements

- Italian invasion of Egypt - Capture of Sollum (September 13, 1940)
- Static defense at Maktila fortified camp (September-December 1940)
- Operation Compass - Battle of Maktila (December 10, 1940)
- Surrender to British Selby Force (December 11, 1940)

## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Overall Confidence:** 82%

### Primary Sources

- Web search - 1st Libyan Division Italy Wikipedia (formation March 1, 1940, strength 7,224 troops)
- Web search - Operation Compass Wikipedia (Maktila position, December 10-11, 1940 destruction)
- Web search - Battle of Sidi Barrani articles (division at Maktila, farthest Italian position)
- Web search - Libyan Paratroop Battalion 'Fanti dell'Aria' (500 paratroopers, 4 companies)
- Web search - Commander Gen. Luigi Sibille confirmed
- Italian colonial division TO&E (2 infantry groups, 1 artillery group, 77/28 guns)
- Operation Compass order of battle (1st Libyan at Maktila, 2nd Libyan at Tummar)

### Known Data Gaps

- Infantry group and artillery group commander names not found
- Exact personnel breakdown by unit uncertain (estimated from standard colonial division structure)
- Precise vehicle numbers estimated from colonial division standards
- Equipment serial numbers unknown
- Detailed battle chronology December 10-11 limited (sandstorm, confusion)
- Exact number of casualties vs prisoners uncertain (all personnel became POWs)

### Additional Notes

⚠️ CRITICAL: Division destroyed December 10-11, 1940 during Operation Compass.

Q1 1941 listing represents final status at time of destruction - division did NOT exist as functional unit during January-March 1941.

Data represents division strength and organization at time of capture (December 1940).

Division formed March 1, 1940 from Italian Libyan Colonial Division.

Commanded by Gen. Luigi Sibille with 7,224 troops (Italian officers, Libyan NCOs/troops).

Positioned at Maktila camp, farthest Italian division into Egypt (22 miles from 2nd Libyan Division).

Attacked December 10, 1940 during sandstorm as first target of Operation Compass.

Offered stiff resistance but disintegrated by December 11.

Surrendered to British Selby Force December 11, 1940 - entire division became POWs.

Organization based on standard Italian colonial division (2 infantry groups, 1 artillery group, 77/28 field guns).

Included elite Libyan Paratroop Battalion 'Fanti dell'Aria' with 500 paratroopers.

Confidence 82% due to good sources on destruction and organization, but limited unit-level detail.

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
