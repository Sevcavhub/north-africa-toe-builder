**Nation:** Italian
**Quarter:** 1943-Q2 (April-June 1943)
**Type:** Infantry Division (Autotrasportabile)
**Parent Formation:** Italian First Army (Tunisia)

---

## Overview

The 136th Infantry Division "Giovani Fascisti" (Young Fascists) was an Italian infantry division formed from the Giovani Fascisti militia organization - the 16-18 year old cohort of Italy's Fascist youth movement. Deployed to Tunisia in late 1942 or early 1943, the division participated in the final defensive operations of the North African campaign before being destroyed at the Axis surrender on May 13, 1943.

**Key Facts:**
- **Formation:** Created from Young Fascists (Giovani Fascisti) volunteer militia battalions
- **Operational Period in Q2 1943:** April 1 - May 13, 1943 (43 days only)
- **Destruction:** Axis surrender at Tunisia, May 13, 1943
- **Renaming:** Redesignated "Cacciatori d'Africa" (African Hunters) before final surrender
- **Personnel:** ~7,200 (significantly depleted from standard 10,000 establishment)
- **Equipment Status:** Critically short of fuel, ammunition, and supplies
- **Combat Experience:** Limited - late deployment to Tunisia theater

## Historical Context

### Young Fascists Militia Background

The **Giovani Fascisti** was the paramilitary youth wing of Italy's Fascist regime, part of the *Gioventù Italiana del Littorio* (GIL - Italian Youth of the Lictor). The organization recruited males aged 16-18 for pre-military training and political indoctrination.

Upon Italy's entry into World War II in 1940, volunteer battalions of Young Fascists were enlisted into 24 special battalions with an official establishment of 19,000 personnel. These units were used for local defense and reinforcement of territorial battalions. The 136th Division was formed from these militia units as a full infantry division.

**Militia Characteristics:**
- High political indoctrination and regime loyalty
- Less professional military training than regular army units
- Younger personnel (16-21 age range at formation)
- Emphasis on ideological commitment over tactical proficiency

### Tunisia Campaign Deployment

The division was deployed to Tunisia theater in late 1942 or early 1943 as Axis forces retreated from Libya into the Tunisia bridgehead following defeat at El Alamein. By Q2 1943 (April-June), the Tunisia perimeter was under sustained Allied assault from both west (US II Corps) and east (British Eighth Army).

**Tunisia Situation April-May 1943:**
- Axis forces compressed into northern Tunisia pocket
- Complete Allied air and naval superiority
- Supply lines from Sicily interdicted - critical shortages
- No possibility of evacuation or reinforcement
- Final Axis resistance before inevitable surrender

### "Cacciatori d'Africa" Renaming

Shortly before the final surrender, the division was renamed **"Cacciatori d'Africa"** (African Hunters). This appears to have been a propaganda/morale measure to:
- Remove the militia "Young Fascists" designation
- Provide a more martial, professional identity
- Boost morale during the final desperate defense

The renaming did not affect the division's organizational structure or combat effectiveness.

## Command Structure

### Division Headquarters

**Commander:** Unknown (Generale di Divisione)
**Chief of Staff:** Unknown (Colonnello)
**Headquarters Location:** Tunisia (mobile defensive positions)

**Staff Strength:** ~200 personnel (35 officers, 55 NCOs, 110 enlisted)

**Data Gap:** The US Army G-2 intelligence document (July 1943) lists the division's existence and basic composition but does not preserve the commander's name. This was likely due to:
1. Division destroyed early in Q2 1943 (May 13)
2. Commander either killed in action or became POW
3. Intelligence priority focused on active units rather than destroyed formations

Research in Italian military archives or postwar POW records may reveal the commander's identity.

## Supply & Logistics

### Supply Status: CRITICAL

By April-May 1943, the division's supply situation was catastrophic:

**Fuel Reserves:** 2 days
**Ammunition:** 3 days of combat operations
**Water:** 3.5 liters per person per day (minimal for desert conditions)
**Operational Radius:** 80 kilometers (severely limited by fuel shortages)

### Supply Challenges

**Allied Interdiction:**
- Complete Allied air superiority prevented daytime movement
- Allied naval forces blocked sea supply routes from Sicily
- Axis air transport (JU-52) insufficient and vulnerable

**Infrastructure Breakdown:**
- Port facilities in Tunisia under constant air attack
- Road network damaged by Allied bombing
- Fuel depot destruction eliminated reserve stocks

**Isolated Bridgehead:**
- No land connection to Axis-held territory
- Tunisia perimeter shrinking under Allied pressure
- Evacuation impossible (Dunkirk-style rescue not attempted)

**Impact on Operations:**
- Vehicle mobility severely constrained
- Artillery ammunition rationed to critical targets only
- Medical supplies insufficient for casualty treatment
- Food shortages affecting combat effectiveness

---

## Tactical Doctrine & Combat Role

### Primary Role

**Defensive Infantry Division** - Tunisia bridgehead final phase

The division's role in Q2 1943 was purely defensive:
- Hold assigned sector of Tunisia perimeter
- Conduct limited counterattacks if ordered
- Delay Allied advance to buy time (for what purpose unclear - no relief possible)
- Fight to final surrender May 13, 1943

### Tactical Characteristics

**Strengths:**
- Truck-mobile capability (autotrasportabile type) for operational mobility
- Young Fascists political background provided ideological commitment
- Standard Italian infantry division fire support (artillery, mortars)

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited combat experience compared to veteran Africa divisions (Ariete, Trieste, Littorio)
- Militia origin - less professional training than regular army
- Youth of personnel (16-21 age range) - limited maturity for sustained combat
- Critically depleted supplies undermined combat effectiveness
- Surrounded position with no escape or reinforcement

### Combat Experience Level: Regular

**Morale Rating:** 5/10 (medium-low)

**Experience Assessment:**
- Division deployed Tunisia late in campaign
- Limited time in combat (probably 3-6 months maximum)
- Final phase operations against overwhelming Allied superiority
- Morale affected by hopeless strategic situation

## Historical Significance

### Tunisia Campaign Endgame

The 136th "Giovani Fascisti" Division was one of many Italian divisions destroyed at the Tunisia surrender, marking the definitive end of Axis operations in North Africa. The Tunisia capitulation saw:

**Axis Losses:**
- 275,000 German and Italian troops surrendered
- Larger than Stalingrad surrender (90,000 Germans)
- Equivalent to losing 20+ divisions
- Italian divisions destroyed: Ariete, Trieste, Centauro, Spezia, Giovani Fascisti, and others

**Strategic Impact:**
- End of Axis presence in North Africa
- Italian mainland now vulnerable to invasion
- Sicily invasion (July 1943) made possible
- Allied forces available for Sicily, Italy, and Normandy operations

### Young Fascists Legacy

The division's destruction marked the end of the Young Fascists militia experiment. The concept of converting ideologically indoctrinated youth into effective military formations proved problematic:

**Lessons Learned:**
- Political indoctrination ≠ military proficiency
- Youth formations require extensive training time
- Militia units less resilient than professional formations under sustained combat stress
- Ideological commitment alone insufficient when facing overwhelming material disadvantage

### Renaming as "Cacciatori d'Africa"

The last-minute renaming to "African Hunters" was a futile propaganda gesture. It reflects:
- Italian command's attempt to maintain morale in hopeless situation
- Desire to distance unit from controversial "Young Fascists" militia background
- Recognition that the division's end was imminent

The renaming had no practical effect and the division is historically remembered by its original "Giovani Fascisti" designation.

## Wargaming Scenarios

### Recommended Scenarios

1. **Tunisia Bridgehead Defense (April 1943)**
   - Division holds sector against Allied probe
   - Supply constraints critical factor
   - Victory conditions: delay enemy advance 24-48 hours

2. **Last Stand (May 1-13, 1943)**
   - Final defense before surrender
   - Ammunition and fuel nearly exhausted
   - Historical scenario: fight until surrender inevitable

3. **Counterattack (hypothetical April 1943)**
   - Limited counterattack to restore positions
   - Fuel shortage limits operational range
   - Small-scale battalion/company level action

### Special Rules (Wargaming)

**For All Scenarios:**
- **Supply Crisis:** Roll for ammunition depletion each turn
- **Fuel Shortages:** Vehicle movement limited to 50% of normal range
- **Low Morale:** -1 to morale checks due to hopeless strategic situation
- **Limited Experience:** Treat as "Regular" quality troops (not Veteran or Elite)
- **Young Fascists Background:** +1 to ideological resilience, -1 to tactical flexibility

**Historical Engagements Setting:**
- Tunisia Campaign April-May 1943 only
- No operations before April 1943 (division not yet in theater)
- No operations after May 13, 1943 (division destroyed)

   - Likely killed or captured May 13, 1943
   - Italian military archives may contain appointment records

2. **Exact Personnel Strength:** Estimated (~7,200)
   - No division strength returns available
   - Based on standard establishment reduced for Tunisia conditions
   - Could range from 6,000-8,000 actual

3. **Detailed Equipment Allocations:** Estimated
   - Specific vehicle and weapon counts unknown
   - Based on standard Italian division TO&E scaled for reduced strength
   - Tunisia depletion estimated at 20-30% equipment losses

4. **Pre-Tunisia Service:** Partially unknown
   - Formation date from Young Fascists militia not precisely documented
   - Training period and location unclear
   - Deployment date to Tunisia approximate (late 1942/early 1943)

5. **Combat Operations Detail:** Limited
   - Specific battles/engagements not documented
   - Sector assignments in Tunisia unknown
   - Casualties and operational reports not available

## Conclusion

The 136ª Divisione di Fanteria "Giovani Fascisti" represents a unique case in North African TO&E extraction: a militia-origin division with limited combat service, destroyed at the Tunisia surrender after only 43 days of operational deployment in Q2 1943.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Formed from Fascist youth militia, not regular army
- Deployed Tunisia late in campaign with limited preparation
- Supply crisis rendered combat effectiveness minimal by April-May 1943
- Destroyed at Axis surrender May 13, 1943 along with rest of Tunisia garrison
- Renamed "Cacciatori d'Africa" before final surrender (propaganda measure)
- Historical significance: example of Axis forces destroyed in Tunisia endgame

**For Wargamers:**
This division is best suited for scenarios depicting the desperate final phase of the Tunisia campaign. Supply constraints, low morale, and overwhelming Allied superiority create challenging but historically authentic gameplay conditions.

**For Historians:**
The division exemplifies the Italian Army's militia conversion experiments and the catastrophic losses of the Tunisia surrender. Further research into Italian archives could significantly improve the documented history of this formation.
