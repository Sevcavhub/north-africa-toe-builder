## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Fortress defense - Tobruk perimeter southern sector. Aggressive patrolling and defensive operations during Axis siege.

### Special Capabilities

- Fortress defense and positional warfare
- Aggressive night patrolling and raiding
- Desert combat and survival
- Anti-tank defense (extensive minefield operations)
- Counter-battery operations (artillery-infantry coordination)
- Siege warfare endurance and morale maintenance

### Tactical Innovations

- Aggressive patrolling doctrine - constant pressure on Axis positions
- Integrated anti-tank defense - guns, mines, obstacles, infantry coordination
- Night operations excellence - Polish patrols dominated no-man's land after dark
- Water conservation and desert survival techniques
- Improvised fortification improvements using captured Italian materials
- High standards of fire discipline and marksmanship (ammunition conservation)

### Known Issues

- Limited water supply - rationing common during summer heat
- Monotonous diet - lack of fresh food caused morale issues
- Isolation - no contact with Polish forces in Palestine except via radio
- Luftwaffe bombing - constant psychological strain from air attacks
- Limited reinforcements - casualties difficult to replace
- Disease burden - dysentery and jaundice endemic in siege conditions
- Equipment attrition - difficult to replace damaged vehicles and weapons

**Desert Adaptations:** Extensive experience with desert survival, water conservation (strict rationing to 2-3 liters/day during heat peaks), heat acclimatization, desert uniform modifications, captured Italian equipment integration, improvised shelter and shade construction, mine warfare expertise (laying and clearing), defensive fortification in rocky terrain.

## Historical Context
