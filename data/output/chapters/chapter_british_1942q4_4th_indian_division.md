## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Infantry division holding center of Allied front at Ruweisat Ridge as diversionary force for Second Battle of El Alamein. Mission: Fix Axis forces in place with 'stiff fighting' while main breakthrough occurs in northern sector.

### Special Capabilities

- Veteran division with continuous desert warfare experience since 1940
- Highly experienced in defensive operations
- Strong brigade cohesion despite dispersal earlier in 1942
- Indian Army mountain warfare expertise adapted to desert

### Tactical Innovations

- Defensive positions on Ruweisat Ridge maximized use of terrain
- Diversionary attacks coordinated with main assault timing
- Integration of 161st Brigade smoothly executed despite short notice

### Known Issues

- No organic armor (infantry division)
- Brigades had been dispersed to other formations until October 1942
- Limited time for reunited division to train together before El Alamein
- 161st Brigade attachment temporary - different training/equipment standards

**Desert Adaptations:** Fully adapted for desert warfare - veteran of multiple desert campaigns (Compass 1940-41, East Africa 1941, Crusader 1941, Gazala 1942). Extensive experience with water discipline, desert navigation, vehicle maintenance in harsh conditions.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 9/10 |

### Special Rules

- Desert warfare veteran bonus (+2 in desert terrain)
- Defensive operations bonus (holding prepared positions)
- Diversionary tactics (enemy cannot determine main effort)
- Indian Army mountain infantry training (applicable to ridge warfare)

### Scenario Suitability

- Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 11 November 1942) - Ruweisat Ridge defensive/diversionary operations
- Static defensive scenarios
