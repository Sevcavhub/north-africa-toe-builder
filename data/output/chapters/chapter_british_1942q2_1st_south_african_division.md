# 1st South African Infantry Division - 1942-Q2 (April-June 1942)

## 1. Unit Overview

**Designation:** 1st South African Infantry Division
**Nation:** British Commonwealth (South African)
**Quarter:** 1942-Q2 (April-June 1942)
**Parent Formation:** XIII Corps, Eighth Army
**Organization Level:** Division
**Total Personnel:** ~17,000 (including 5,000 non-Europeans)

### Historical Context

The 1st South African Infantry Division entered Q2 1942 deployed along the coastal sector of the Gazala Line, marking a significant milestone: this was the first quarter the division operated with its full three-brigade strength following the transfer of 3rd SA Brigade from 2nd SA Division on 21 March 1942. The quarter encompassed two distinct operational phases:

**Phase 1 (April-May):** Static defense along prepared positions on the northern Gazala Line, maintaining readiness for the anticipated Axis offensive while recovering from Operation Crusader losses.

**Phase 2 (26 May - 30 June):** The Battle of Gazala and subsequent withdrawal. When Rommel launched his offensive on 26 May 1942, the division successfully defended its coastal sector against Italian Sabratha Division breakthrough attempts. However, the collapse of the southern flank forced a withdrawal along the coastal road to Mersa Matruh, which the division executed successfully without the catastrophic losses suffered by 2nd SA Division at Tobruk.

The division's performance during this quarter demonstrated both the strengths of Commonwealth defensive doctrine when properly executed and the vulnerabilities of static positions to mobile warfare conducted by experienced German forces.

## 3. Command

**Commanding Officer:** Maj-Gen Dan Pienaar
**Appointment Date:** 10 March 1942
**Previous Command:** Commander, 1st SA Infantry Brigade (1940-1942)

Major-General Dan Pienaar assumed command of 1st SA Division on 10 March 1942 following the evacuation of Lt-Gen George Edwin Brink due to a back injury. Pienaar had previously commanded the division's 1st Brigade and was promoted to Major-General specifically for this posting. He brought extensive combat experience from the East African Campaign (1940-1941), for which he was awarded the Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

Pienaar's command during Q2 1942 was characterized by:
- **First Full-Strength Deployment:** On 26 May 1942, Pienaar warned his division of the impending Axis offensive - this was the first time he commanded all three brigades simultaneously under divisional control.
- **Defensive Leadership:** Successfully defended the coastal sector of the Gazala Line against Italian breakthrough attempts.
- **Withdrawal Expertise:** Conducted a fighting withdrawal along the coastal road to Mersa Matruh without the catastrophic losses that befell 2nd SA Division at Tobruk.
- **Artillery Concentration:** Anticipated the defensive artillery doctrine that would prove decisive at First El Alamein (July 1942).

**Chief of Staff:** Unknown (Colonel)
**Headquarters Location:**
- April-May: Gazala Line, coastal sector
- June: Withdrawal to Mersa Matruh

**Staff Strength:**
- Officers: 43
- NCOs: 104
- Enlisted: 60
- Total HQ Personnel: 207

## 4. Personnel Summary

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Officers** | 723 | 4.3% |
| **NCOs** | 2,410 | 14.2% |
| **Enlisted** | 13,867 | 81.5% |
| **Total** | **17,000** | **100%** |

**Non-European Personnel:** Approximately 5,000 (29.4%)

The division maintained integrated non-European personnel throughout its support services, including transport, supply, medical, workshop, and labor units. This was standard practice for South African forces in WWII and significantly increased the number of European personnel available for combat roles.

**Personnel Distribution by Component:**
- Infantry Brigades (3): ~12,387 (72.9%)
- Divisional Artillery: ~2,156 (12.7%)
- Machine Gun Units: ~428 (2.5%)
- Engineers: ~324 (1.9%)
- Signals: ~435 (2.6%)
- Medical Services: ~340 (2.0%)
- Support Services: ~930 (5.4%)

**Nafziger Strength Notation:** The primary source (Nafziger 942BFAA, dated 2 June 1942) provides personnel strengths in the format: Officers/Enlisted/Natives/C.C. (Cape Coloured personnel). For example, an infantry battalion strength of "33/672/77/172" indicates: 33 officers, 672 enlisted Europeans, 77 native Africans, and 172 Cape Coloured personnel.

## 5. Artillery

The 1st South African Division fielded one of the strongest divisional artillery organizations in XIII Corps, with 96 field guns supplemented by attached medium artillery.

### Field Artillery - 96 Guns Total

**Ordnance QF 25-pounder (87.6mm) - 96 guns**

**Organization:**
- **1st SA Field Regiment:** 24x 25-pdr (46 officers, 639 enlisted, 76 natives, 50 C.C.)
- **4th SA Field Regiment:** 24x 25-pdr (46 officers, 639 enlisted, 76 natives, 50 C.C.)
- **5th SA Field Regiment:** 24x 25-pdr (46 officers, 639 enlisted, 76 natives, 50 C.C.)
- **7th SA Field Regiment:** 24x 25-pdr (46 officers, 639 enlisted, 76 natives, 50 C.C.)

**Performance:** The 25-pounder was the standard British Commonwealth field gun, providing excellent indirect fire support. Each regiment consisted of three batteries of 8 guns each. The weapon's dual role as both field artillery and anti-tank gun (in direct fire mode) provided tactical flexibility, though its anti-tank performance was limited against heavier German armor.

**Tactical Employment:** During the Battle of Gazala, the division's four field regiments provided concentrated fire support for the defensive positions. This concentration of artillery firepower would later prove decisive during the division's defense at First El Alamein in July 1942, where Pienaar massed his divisional artillery and available medium regiments to devastating effect.

**Attached Medium Artillery:**
- **67th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery**
- **68th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery**

These British medium regiments were attached to provide long-range fire support, though the exact gun types (likely 4.5-inch or 5.5-inch medium guns) are not specified in available sources. Their presence significantly increased the division's artillery firepower and range.

### Anti-Tank Artillery - 52 Guns

**Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40mm) - 52 guns**

**Organization:**
- **1st SA Anti-Tank Regiment:** 26x 2-pdr (24 officers, 670 enlisted, 47 natives, 75 C.C.)
- **2nd SA Anti-Tank Regiment:** 26x 2-pdr (24 officers, 670 enlisted, 47 natives, 75 C.C.)

**Critical Deficiency:** The 2-pounder anti-tank gun was rapidly becoming obsolete by June 1942. While effective against early-war tanks and Italian M13/40s, it was inadequate against German Panzer III (50mm frontal armor) and Panzer IV (50-80mm frontal armor) at combat ranges. The 2-pdr's 40mm solid shot could penetrate approximately 40-45mm of armor at 500 yards, but German armor improvements had outpaced this capability.

**6-pounder Introduction:** By June 1942, the superior QF 6-pounder (57mm) was beginning to enter service with Eighth Army. Sources indicate that "only 112 6-pdrs had been issued" to the entire army by the time of Gazala, and "many anti-tank batteries still only had 2-pdrs." The 1st SA Division's anti-tank regiments were among those still predominantly equipped with 2-pounders during this quarter.

**Historical Impact:** This anti-tank deficiency was a critical vulnerability. During the Gazala battles, German armor could engage 2-pounder positions from outside their effective range, destroying the guns before they could inflict damage. This forced infantry battalions to rely heavily on field artillery in direct-fire mode and created the "tank panic" that plagued Commonwealth forces.

**Boys Anti-Tank Rifle - 4 rifles (limited issue)**
- Caliber: 13.9mm
- Role: Infantry battalion anti-tank defense
- Note: Largely ineffective by 1942, retained only for light vehicles

### Anti-Aircraft Artillery - 26 Guns

**1st SA Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment**
- **Bofors 40mm:** 20 guns (31 officers, 588 enlisted, 153 natives, 208 C.C.)
- **QF 3-inch:** 6 guns (part of same regiment)

The Bofors 40mm was an excellent light anti-aircraft weapon, effective against low-flying aircraft and also useful in ground support roles. The 3-inch guns provided medium-altitude coverage.

## 6. Armored Cars

**Total: 72 vehicles**

The division's reconnaissance capability relied on South African-manufactured Marmon-Herrington armored cars, specifically designed for African conditions.

### Marmon-Herrington Mk II - 38 vehicles (35 operational)
- **Armament:** Typically 1x Boys anti-tank rifle, 1x Bren light machine gun
- **Armor:** 12mm maximum
- **Crew:** 4
- **Role:** Reconnaissance, screening

### Marmon-Herrington Mk III - 34 vehicles (31 operational)
- **Armament:** Typically 1x 2-pounder gun or additional machine guns
- **Armor:** 12mm maximum (some variants up to 20mm)
- **Crew:** 4
- **Role:** Reconnaissance, fire support

**Production & Design:** The Marmon-Herrington armored cars were manufactured in South Africa using imported American Marmon-Herrington chassis and locally-produced armored bodies. They were specifically designed for desert conditions with:
- Excellent desert mobility
- Reliable American mechanical components
- Water-cooled engines suitable for hot climates
- Large fuel capacity for extended range
- Simple maintenance requirements

**Operational Use:** These armored cars provided the division's reconnaissance capability, but lacked the firepower and armor protection to engage German armored cars (SdKfz 222, 231) or light tanks effectively. They were most effective in screening operations and providing early warning of enemy movements.

## 7. Transport & Mobility

### Trucks - 1,556 vehicles

**Ford 3-ton:** 748 trucks
- Primary heavy transport
- Capacity: 3 tons or 30 men
- Role: Battalion transport, supply hauling

**Bedford MW 15cwt:** 464 trucks
- Capacity: 15 hundredweight (0.75 tons)
- Role: Company-level transport, signals, liaison

**Chevrolet C15A:** 344 trucks
- Capacity: 15 hundredweight
- Role: Light transport, signals, staff vehicles

**Mobility Assessment:** The division's extensive motor transport provided complete mobility for all personnel and equipment. Unlike pure infantry divisions that relied on divisional RASC companies for transport, the South African divisions were fully motorized with organic transport companies. This enabled rapid redeployment along the coastal road during the June withdrawal.

### Motorcycles - 162 vehicles

**BSA M20:** 100 motorcycles
- Type: 500cc solo motorcycle
- Role: Dispatch riders, reconnaissance

**Norton 16H:** 62 motorcycles
- Type: 500cc solo motorcycle
- Role: Dispatch riders, communications

### Support Vehicles - 244 vehicles

**Bren Carrier (Universal Carrier):** 108 vehicles
- Role: Infantry support, reconnaissance platoons, mortar carriers
- Crew: 2-3
- Armament: Typically 1x Bren gun

**Ambulances:** 72 vehicles
- Type: Austin K2 and similar
- Role: Medical evacuation

**Workshop Vehicles:** 42 vehicles
- Role: Mobile maintenance and repair

**Water Bowsers:** 22 vehicles
- Capacity: ~400 gallons each
- Role: Water distribution in desert conditions
- Critical for survival in 30-35°C June temperatures

## 8. Infantry Weapons

### Top 3 Infantry Weapons

**1. Lee-Enfield No. 1 Mk III Rifle - 11,340 rifles**
- Type: Bolt-action rifle
- Caliber: .303 British (7.7mm)
- Effective Range: 550 yards
- Rate of Fire: 15-20 rounds/minute (trained soldier)
- Magazine: 10-round detachable box

The Lee-Enfield was the standard British Commonwealth rifle, renowned for its accuracy, reliability, and rapid bolt operation. South African troops were highly proficient with this weapon.

**2. Bren Light Machine Gun - 560 guns**
- Type: Light machine gun
- Caliber: .303 British
- Effective Range: 600 yards
- Rate of Fire: 500-520 rounds/minute (cyclic)
- Magazine: 30-round detachable box

The Bren was the primary squad automatic weapon, providing sustained fire support at section level. Each infantry section (10 men) had one Bren gun.

**3. Vickers Medium Machine Gun - 96 guns**
- Type: Medium machine gun (water-cooled)
- Caliber: .303 British
- Effective Range: 2,000+ yards
- Rate of Fire: 450-550 rounds/minute (sustained)
- Feed: 250-round fabric belt

The Vickers provided sustained fire support at company and battalion level, particularly effective in defensive positions. The machine gun battalions (Regiment Botha, Regiment President Steyn) concentrated these weapons for battalion-level fire support.

### Mortars - 132 tubes

**Ordnance ML 3-inch Mortar - 132 tubes**
- Caliber: 76.2mm (3 inches)
- Range: Maximum 2,800 yards
- Rate of Fire: 10 rounds/minute (sustained)
- Role: Infantry battalion indirect fire support
- Organization: 14 mortars per infantry battalion (9 battalions), plus additional in support units

The 3-inch mortar provided immediate indirect fire support at battalion level. Its high-angle fire was particularly effective in prepared defensive positions, allowing engagement of targets in dead ground.

## 10. Supply & Logistics

### Supply Status

**April-May 1942 (Defensive Phase):**
The division benefited from static positions along the Gazala Line with established supply depots. Primary supply route from Tobruk (35km) provided reliable logistics. Water supply was adequate from coastal wells and transported water. The division maintained approximately 17,000 men at near-full strength during this period.

**26 May - 14 June (Battle of Gazala):**
Rommel's offensive disrupted supply lines as Axis forces broke through the southern flank. The division's coastal position initially protected supply routes, but increasing pressure forced ammunition and fuel rationing. Water became critical in rising June temperatures (30-35°C).

**15-30 June (Withdrawal):**
Successful withdrawal along coastal road to Mersa Matruh maintained supply continuity. Division avoided the supply collapse that contributed to 2nd SA Division's surrender at Tobruk (21 June). Mobile supply columns supported the withdrawal effectively.

### Operational Logistics

**Operational Radius:** 195 km
- Improved from Q1 1942 (185 km) due to better supply organization
- Limited by fuel consumption and water requirements
- Sufficient for coastal road withdrawal operations

**Fuel Reserves:** 7 days
- Based on normal operational tempo
- Reduced to 3-4 days during intensive combat operations
- Improved from Q1 (6.5 days) through better stockpiling

**Ammunition Reserves:** 9 days
- Calculated at normal defensive expenditure rates
- Significantly reduced during intensive Gazala battles (26 May - 14 June)
- 25-pounder ammunition consumption heavy during defensive fire missions

**Water Supply:** 4.5 liters per man per day
- Minimum for survival and basic hygiene in desert conditions
- Rising June temperatures (30-35°C) increased requirements to 6+ liters/day
- Water bowsers (22 vehicles) critical for distribution
- Coastal positions provided access to desalination and wells

### Supply Challenges

1. **Rising Temperatures:** June temperatures of 30-35°C increased water requirements significantly, straining supply capacity.

2. **Anti-Tank Ammunition Obsolescence:** 2-pounder ammunition increasingly ineffective against upgraded German armor, but 6-pounder ammunition not yet available in quantity.

3. **Fuel Consumption During Withdrawal:** June withdrawal consumed significant fuel reserves, though successful logistics prevented operational paralysis.

4. **Port Capacity Limitations:** Tobruk's limited port capacity constrained overall XIII Corps supply, affecting divisional resupply rates.

5. **Non-European Personnel Integration:** Approximately 5,000 non-European support personnel required culturally appropriate rations and medical support, increasing logistics complexity.

## 11. Tactical Doctrine

### Primary Role

The 1st SA Division's role in Q2 1942 evolved through two distinct phases:

**Defensive Operations (April-May):**
Static defense of the coastal sector of the Gazala Line, preparing for anticipated Axis offensive. The division held positions from the coast southward, linking with 50th (Northumbrian) Division. Defensive positions included minefields, wire obstacles, and mutually supporting "boxes" with interlocking fields of fire.

**Battle & Withdrawal (May-June):**
When Rommel launched his offensive on 26 May, the division defended successfully against Italian Sabratha Division breakthrough attempts. However, the collapse of the southern flank at Bir Hakeim forced a fighting withdrawal along the coastal road to Mersa Matruh, completed by month's end without catastrophic losses.

### Tactical Innovations

1. **Concentrated Artillery Doctrine:** Pienaar anticipated the massed artillery tactics that would prove decisive at El Alamein, concentrating all four field regiments and attached medium artillery under unified fire control.

2. **Marmon-Herrington Employment:** Effective use of locally-produced armored cars for reconnaissance and screening, optimized for African desert conditions.

3. **Integrated Non-European Personnel:** Approximately 5,000 non-European personnel integrated in support roles, maximizing European combat strength - a model that maximized limited manpower.

4. **Defensive Box System:** Well-prepared defensive positions along Gazala Line with interlocking fields of fire, though ultimately outflanked by German mobile operations.

5. **Fighting Withdrawal Doctrine:** Successful conduct of withdrawal operations demonstrated excellent staff work and discipline, contrasting sharply with 2nd SA Division's fate at Tobruk.

### Known Weaknesses

1. **Anti-Tank Deficiency:** 2-pounder anti-tank guns inadequate against German Panzer III/IV. Limited 6-pounder availability by June 1942 left division critically vulnerable to armor attack.

2. **Lack of Organic Armor:** Infantry division with no organic tank units, dependent on Corps-level armor support that often failed to materialize during Gazala.

3. **Static Defense Vulnerability:** Defensive positions on Gazala Line vulnerable to outflanking maneuvers, as demonstrated by Rommel's "left hook" around Bir Hakeim on 26-27 May.

4. **Communication Challenges:** Coordination with attached British units (67th/68th Medium Regiments RA) required inter-unit liaison that sometimes failed under pressure.

5. **Heat Degradation:** Rising summer temperatures (30-35°C in June) significantly reduced operational effectiveness, particularly during withdrawal operations.

6. **Artillery Mobility:** While powerful in static defense, field artillery struggled to provide effective mobile support during withdrawal, a limitation of the 25-pounder's towed configuration.

## 12. Critical Equipment Shortages

### Priority 1 (Critical Operational Impact)

**1. QF 6-pounder Anti-Tank Guns**
- **Current:** 52x 2-pounder (40mm) guns
- **Required:** 52x 6-pounder (57mm) guns
- **Impact:** 2-pounders inadequate against German Panzer III (50mm frontal armor) and Panzer IV (50-80mm). German tanks could engage 2-pdr positions from outside their effective range (600-800 yards vs. 500 yards for 2-pdr). Critical vulnerability during Gazala battles.
- **Status:** Only 112x 6-pdrs issued to entire Eighth Army by June 1942. 1st SA Division still predominantly equipped with obsolete 2-pdrs.

**2. Infantry Tanks (Churchill or Valentine)**
- **Current:** 0 tanks (infantry division)
- **Required:** 42-50 infantry tanks for organic armor support
- **Impact:** Division completely dependent on Corps-level armor support. During Gazala, this support often failed to materialize, leaving infantry vulnerable to German armor. Lessons from Operation Crusader demonstrated need for organic armor in infantry divisions.
- **Status:** Limited Churchill and Valentine production allocated primarily to armored divisions and independent tank brigades. Infantry divisions remained without organic armor throughout 1942.

### Priority 2 (Significant Operational Impact)

**3. Medium Machine Guns**
- **Current:** 96x Vickers MMG (concentrated in machine gun battalions)
- **Required:** Additional 60-80 MMGs for battalion-level distribution
- **Impact:** While machine gun battalions (Regiment Botha, Regiment President Steyn) provided concentrated fire support, infantry battalions lacked immediate sustained fire capability. In defensive operations, more dispersed machine gun capability would have improved position defense.

**4. Armored Personnel Carriers**
- **Current:** 108x Bren Carriers (limited capacity)
- **Required:** 200+ Universal Carriers or equivalent for all infantry sections
- **Impact:** Infantry largely moved by truck, dismounting to fight on foot. Under German air attack or artillery fire during withdrawal, unarmored trucks provided no protection. Bren Carriers provided some protection but insufficient quantity.

**5. Modern Armored Cars**
- **Current:** 72x Marmon-Herrington Mk II/III (12-20mm armor, light armament)
- **Required:** 80-100x Humber or Daimler armored cars (30mm armor, 2-pdr/37mm guns)
- **Impact:** Marmon-Herrington cars outclassed by German SdKfz 222/231 armored cars and light tanks. Inadequate for offensive reconnaissance or combat engagement with enemy reconnaissance forces.

### Priority 3 (Moderate Operational Impact)

**6. Wireless Sets**
- **Current:** Limited No. 19 and No. 11 wireless sets
- **Required:** Additional sets for company-level communications
- **Impact:** Battalion-level communications adequate, but company and platoon communications limited to line telephone or runners. Under mobile operations or German artillery fire, this degraded command and control.

**7. Anti-Aircraft Artillery**
- **Current:** 20x Bofors 40mm, 6x 3-inch AA guns
- **Required:** Additional 20-30 Bofors 40mm for comprehensive coverage
- **Impact:** Luftwaffe retained air superiority during Gazala. Additional AA guns would have provided better protection for division positions and transport columns, particularly during June withdrawal.

**8. Engineer Equipment**
- **Current:** Limited bridging, mine-clearing, and demolition equipment across three field companies
- **Required:** Additional mine detectors, explosive charges, and assault bridging
- **Impact:** Gazala Line defensive positions adequately prepared, but limited mine-clearing equipment hampered offensive patrolling. During withdrawal, limited demolition capacity reduced ability to delay German pursuit.

## 13. Combat Performance Assessment

### Strengths Demonstrated

1. **Defensive Capability:** Successfully defended coastal sector of Gazala Line against Italian Sabratha Division breakthrough attempts. Prepared positions with minefields and wire obstacles proved effective when properly supported.

2. **Artillery Excellence:** Concentrated fire support from four field regiments plus attached medium artillery provided devastating defensive firepower. This foreshadowed successful artillery employment at First El Alamein (July 1942).

3. **Withdrawal Discipline:** Conducted orderly fighting withdrawal along coastal road to Mersa Matruh without catastrophic losses or panic. Stark contrast to 2nd SA Division's surrender at Tobruk (21 June) demonstrated superior staff work and unit discipline.

4. **Full Brigade Strength:** First quarter with all three brigades under division command (3rd Brigade transferred 21 March 1942) provided increased tactical flexibility and depth.

5. **Desert Experience:** Veterans of East African Campaign and Operation Crusader, division demonstrated excellent desert navigation, water discipline, and defensive position construction.

### Weaknesses Exposed

1. **Anti-Tank Inadequacy:** 2-pounder guns unable to engage German armor effectively. German tanks operated outside 2-pdr effective range, destroying AT positions with impunity. This forced dangerous reliance on field artillery in direct-fire anti-tank role.

2. **Static Defense Vulnerability:** Gazala Line positions outflanked by Rommel's mobile operations around southern flank. Fixed defenses proved vulnerable to German combined-arms mobile warfare doctrine.

3. **Lack of Offensive Power:** Infantry division without organic armor lacked capability for counterattacks. Dependent on Corps-level armor support that often failed to materialize during crisis.

4. **Communication Difficulties:** Coordination with attached British units (medium artillery regiments) occasionally broke down under pressure, degrading fire support effectiveness.

5. **Heat Casualties:** June temperatures (30-35°C) caused significant heat exhaustion casualties during withdrawal operations, reducing effective combat strength.

## 14. Historical Engagements

### Battle of Gazala (26 May - 14 June 1942)

**Context:**
On 26 May 1942, Field Marshal Rommel launched his long-anticipated offensive against the Gazala Line. While the main effort consisted of Afrika Korps' "left hook" around the southern flank at Bir Hakeim, Italian forces attacked the northern sectors to pin down Commonwealth forces.

**1st SA Division Role:**
The division held the coastal sector of the Gazala Line, the northernmost position of XIII Corps. Initial attacks by Italian Sabratha Division were repulsed by 2nd SA Brigade. However, the collapse of the southern flank following Bir Hakeim's fall (10-11 June) threatened to cut off the division.

**Key Actions:**
- **27-30 May:** Repulsed Italian Sabratha Division attacks on northern sector
- **31 May - 12 June:** Maintained defensive positions while battle raged in "Cauldron" to south
- **13 June:** Risk of encirclement as Axis forces broke through southern flank
- **14 June:** Received withdrawal order from XIII Corps HQ

**Outcome:**
Division successfully disengaged from Gazala Line without catastrophic losses, maintaining unit cohesion and most equipment. This contrasted sharply with other Commonwealth units trapped or destroyed during the battle.

### Withdrawal to Mersa Matruh (15-30 June 1942)

**Context:**
Following Gazala defeat, Eighth Army withdrew eastward toward Egyptian border. 1st SA Division moved along coastal road while 2nd SA Division remained at Tobruk (subsequently forced to surrender 21 June with 33,000 men).

**Route:**
Gazala Line → Tobruk (bypassed) → Bardia → Sollum → Halfaya Pass → Mersa Matruh

**Challenges:**
- Constant German air attacks from Luftwaffe
- Pursuit by German reconnaissance elements
- Rising temperatures (30-35°C) causing heat casualties
- Ammunition and fuel shortages
- Dust clouds marking division's movement for German observation

**Success Factors:**
- Excellent staff work maintaining supply lines
- Disciplined march order and traffic control
- Effective rear-guard actions by brigade elements
- Maintenance of wireless communications
- Water discipline preventing heat casualties from escalating

**Arrival:**
Division reached Mersa Matruh area by 30 June 1942, substantially intact and ready for future operations. This withdrawal success preserved the division for its critical role at First El Alamein (1-27 July 1942).
