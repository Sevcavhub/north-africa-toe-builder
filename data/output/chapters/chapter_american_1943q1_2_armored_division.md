# 2nd Armored Division "Hell on Wheels" - Tunisia Campaign Training Period

**Nation:** American
**Quarter:** 1943-Q1 (January-March 1943)
**Organization Level:** Division
**Type:** Armored Division (Heavy)

---

## Summary

The 2nd Armored Division "Hell on Wheels" spent 1943-Q1 primarily in Morocco conducting intensive training for the upcoming invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). While small elements (75 officers and 175 enlisted personnel) deployed to support II Corps in Tunisia, including combat actions at Beja, the main body of the division remained along the Spanish Morocco frontier training with Fifth Army. This period marked a transition from the "Green" unit that landed at Casablanca in November 1942 to a more experienced "Regular" formation ready for amphibious assault operations. Major General Ernest N. Harmon commanded through March 1943 before transferring to the 1st Armored Division on April 6, 1943.

## Tactical Doctrine

### Primary Role (1943-Q1)
Training for amphibious assault operations while maintaining heavy armored division capability. Focus shifted from desert warfare to amphibious operations in preparation for Sicily invasion.

### Special Capabilities

1. **Heavy Division Structure**
   - 18 tank companies (vs. 12 in light divisions)
   - Two full armored regiments
   - Superior sustained striking power
   - More complex but more powerful organization

2. **Amphibious Assault Capability (Developing)**
   - Intensive training with Fifth Army
   - Beach landing procedures
   - Tank waterproofing and deep wading
   - Ship-to-shore coordination

3. **Combat Command Flexibility**
   - CCA and CCB refined through training
   - Task organization for specific missions
   - Independent operations capability
   - Combined arms integration

4. **Equipment Modernization**
   - Rapid transition to M4 Sherman (170 total)
   - M3 Lee phase-out nearly complete (15 remaining)
   - M5 Stuart replacing M3 Stuart in light tank role
   - Modern M5 3-inch anti-tank guns

### Tactical Innovations (1943-Q1)

1. **Amphibious Armored Operations**
   - First U.S. heavy armored division to focus on amphibious training
   - Development of beach landing SOPs for armor
   - Integration with Navy transport and support

2. **Lessons from Torch Integration**
   - Dispersed landing procedures refined
   - Ship-to-shore communication improvements
   - Beach organization and traffic control
   - Combined arms coordination from landing

3. **Combat Command Evolution**
   - Task force organization standardized
   - Command and control procedures improved
   - Flexible force packaging for varied missions

### Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Limited Combat Experience in 1943-Q1**
   - Only small elements in Tunisia combat
   - Main body untested in sustained operations
   - Training exercises not equivalent to battle experience
   - Green troops still learning equipment and tactics

2. **Heavy Division Complexity**
   - Large, unwieldy organization (14,820 personnel)
   - Command and control challenging
   - Logistically demanding
   - Later experience would show light divisions more manageable

3. **Equipment Transition Period**
   - Still operating mix of M3 Lee and M4 Sherman
   - M5 Stuart integration ongoing
   - Crews adapting to new equipment
   - Maintenance learning curve

4. **Amphibious Inexperience**
   - No previous amphibious assaults under fire
   - Training vs. reality gap
   - Coordination with Navy still developing
   - Beach landing under fire not yet experienced

### Desert Adaptations (Continued)

**Morocco Training Period Benefits:**
- Vehicle maintenance procedures refined
- Sand filter operations standardized
- Crew endurance and heat management
- Water discipline and supply management
- Navigation techniques in open terrain

**Shift to Amphibious Focus:**
While desert adaptation continued, primary focus shifted to amphibious operations:
- Beach reconnaissance techniques
- Tank waterproofing and deep wading
- Coordinated beach landing procedures
- Ship-to-shore communication

---

## Supply and Logistics

**Supply Status:** Good - garrison and training duties

The division remained in Morocco on the Spanish Morocco frontier for intensive training with Fifth Army in preparation for the Sicily invasion. Elements (75 officers, 175 enlisted) detached to II Corps in Tunisia provided limited combat support. The main body of the division focused on amphibious training and unit reorganization. Supply lines remained secure from Casablanca with no significant supply constraints during the training period.

**Key Supply Metrics:**
- **Operational Radius:** 260 km (+10 km from improved fuel management)
- **Fuel Reserves:** 7 days (+1 day from 1942-Q4)
- **Ammunition:** 12 days supply (+2 days)
- **Water:** 5.5 liters per person per day

**Supply Advantages:**
- Based near Casablanca with excellent port facilities
- No extended combat operations
- Time for depot organization and stock buildup
- Training allowed supply procedure refinement
- Preparation for Sicily logistics challenges

**Amphibious Supply Preparation:**
- Ship loading procedures developed
- Beach supply dump organization
- Mobile supply procedures for rapid advance
- Coordination with Navy logistics

**Report completed for wargaming scenario development.**

*This TO&E represents the 2nd Armored Division during its training period in Morocco (January-March 1943) with limited element deployment to Tunisia. The division's primary focus was preparation for the Sicily invasion rather than Tunisia Campaign participation. Main combat debut as a complete division would occur at Gela, Sicily on July 10, 1943.*
