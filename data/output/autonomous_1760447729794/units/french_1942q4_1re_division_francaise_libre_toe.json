Equipment is predominantly British-supplied Commonwealth standard issue, with some retained French colonial equipment. The division had NO organic armor - all tanks were British units in support when needed. Personnel include Foreign Legionnaires (13e DBLE), North African troops, Pacific Island troops, and French colonial forces from Equatorial Africa."
