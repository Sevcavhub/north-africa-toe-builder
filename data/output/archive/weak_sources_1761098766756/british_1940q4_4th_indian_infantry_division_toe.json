Artillery composition confirmed as three field regiments (1st, 25th, 31st Field Regiments RA) with 72x 25-pounders total, plus divisional anti-tank regiment with 48x 2-pounders. Personnel strength maintained at 17,800 through 14 December due to 16th Brigade attachment. Supply status improved from Q3 due to pre-offensive preparations. Location transitioned from Egypt (Western Desert) to Sudan within Q4. Commander Beresford-Peirse continued from Q3 appointment. Confidence increased to 82% due to well-documented Operation Compass participation and multiple source confirmation of key dates and actions."
