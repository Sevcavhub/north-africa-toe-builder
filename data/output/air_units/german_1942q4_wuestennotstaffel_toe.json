Aircraft strength degraded by British raids and deliberate destruction during retreat. Commander Oblt Heinz Ebert succeeded Hptm Heinz Kroseberg (KIA May 12, 1942). Specific aircraft counts estimated based on typical staffel strength (9 aircraft at full strength in October 1941) and documented losses/damage during retreat. Unit relocated frequently during retreat from Egypt through Libya toward Tunisia. By end of Q4 1942, unit was approaching Tunisian border.",
