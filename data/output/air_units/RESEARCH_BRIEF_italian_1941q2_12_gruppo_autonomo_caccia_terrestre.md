## Historical Record Gap Analysis

**Problem**: Asisbiz source shows unit moved to Italy for training in February 1941, then next verified data point is December 1941 in Libya.

**Questions**:
1. When did unit return to Libya from Italy training?
2. Was unit operational in Q2 1941 or still training in Italy?
3. If operational, what was aircraft strength?
4. What specific operations during Siege of Tobruk (began April 1941)?

**Source Gaps**:
- Shores' Air War Vol 1 (1940-1942) - NOT AVAILABLE to agent
- Italian official records - NOT AVAILABLE
- Detailed Regia Aeronautica OOB for Q2 1941 - NOT FOUND

## Estimation Possibilities (IF AUTHORIZED)

### Aircraft Count Estimation
**Method**: Standard Italian fighter gruppo establishment
- **Standard establishment**: 27-30 aircraft per gruppo (9-10 per squadriglia)
- **North Africa reality**: Often under-strength due to attrition and supply
- **Estimate**: 18-24 G.50 Freccia (60-80% of establishment)
- **Confidence**: 40% (no primary source)

### Personnel Estimation
**Method**: Italian fighter gruppo standard ratios
- **Pilots**: ~27 (1:1 with aircraft establishment)
- **Ground crew**: ~120-150 (4-5:1 ratio)
- **Total**: ~150-180
- **Confidence**: 30% (pure estimation)

### Variant Identification
**Method**: Production timeline analysis
- **G.50 Serie I**: Initial production 1938-1939
- **G.50bis**: Main production 1940-1941
- **Most likely**: Fiat G.50bis (improved variant in production during 1941)
- **Confidence**: 60% (timeline-based inference)

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Research Brief Only (CURRENT)
- Create JSON with minimal verified data
- Mark as `tier: "research_brief_created"`
- Document all gaps explicitly
- NO ESTIMATES (per anti-hallucination protocol)

### Option 2: Estimate-Based Extraction (REQUIRES USER AUTHORIZATION)
- Use standard Italian fighter gruppo establishment
- Clearly mark ALL estimates
- Confidence: 40-50% maximum
- Tier: `partial_needs_research`

### Option 3: Defer Extraction (RECOMMENDED)
- **WAIT** for Shores sources to become available
- **WAIT** for Italian official records
- **WAIT** for WITW database integration
- Extract when Tier 1/2 sources accessible

## Conclusion

**CANNOT COMPLETE TIER 1/2 EXTRACTION** for 12¬∞ Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre in 1941-Q2.

**Reason**: Historical record gap between February 1941 (training in Italy) and December 1941 (operational in Libya). Available sources do not contain:
- Aircraft counts for Q2 1941
- Personnel numbers
- Operational data (sorties, claims, losses)
- Supply status
- Specific combat participation details

**Confidence in available data**: 60% (unit structure and commander verified, but operational details missing)

**Recommended action**: Create research brief JSON only, mark as `research_brief_created` tier, await better sources.
