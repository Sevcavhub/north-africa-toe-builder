Historical record shows: Unit transferred to Libya January 25, 1941 from Belgium with 31 Fiat G.50 Freccia fighters. Organized in three squadriglie: 351a, 360a, 378a. Reinforced May 27, 1941 with 151a Squadriglia equipped with improved G.50bis variant. Commanded by Maggiore pilota Pietro Bianchi (UNVERIFIED from Tier 1 sources). Operated during Siege of Tobruk conducting fighter sweeps, convoy protection, intercepts, and bomber escort missions (sometimes jointly with Luftwaffe). Suffered from desert sand infiltration until engine filters fitted. Later suffered catastrophic losses November 19, 1941 at Sidi Rezegh (18 aircraft destroyed on ground) and December 22, 1941 at Agedabia (5 aircraft lost). Note: 351a Squadriglia appears with 155° Gruppo Autonomo C.T. in July 1941, suggesting squadriglia reassignment between Q2 and Q3 1941. Available sources lack: specific Q2 aircraft counts, personnel numbers, operational data (sorties/claims/losses for April-June 1941), supply status, verified base location(s), ground support vehicles, ordnance stocks, WITW IDs. Recommend deferring extraction until Christopher Shores Mediterranean Air War series or Italian Air Force official records become available. DO NOT USE THESE PLACEHOLDER VALUES FOR ANALYSIS.",
