Squadron operated from Wittering (UK) in October, moved to Gibraltar in early November, then deployed to Algeria (Maison Blanche) on 14 November 1942. Moved to Souk-el-Arba in late November, then Constantine in December. Aircraft mix represents transition period with both Spitfire Mk Vb (earlier variant) and Mk Vc (tropical variant with better armament). Personnel estimates based on standard RAF fighter squadron establishment. Supply status 'strained' reflects long supply lines from Algeria during initial North Africa deployment. Commander name not available in accessible sources - would require RAF Operations Record Books (Form 540/541).",
