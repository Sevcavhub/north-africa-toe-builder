Anton Mader (86 kills). Aircraft variants include primarily Bf 109G-2/Trop with some remaining Bf 109F-4/Trop aircraft. The unit operated from Castel Benito during the final two weeks of December 1942. Base locations: Neapel (1-2 Dec), Bari (2-4 Dec), Comiso (4-11 Dec), Chinisia (11-13 Dec), Tripolis (13-18 Dec), Castel Benito (18 Dec - 5 Jan 1943). Supply situation was strained due to Allied air superiority and constant attacks on Luftwaffe bases. Personnel and aircraft numbers are standard Gruppe establishment with adjustments for operational attrition. Staffel composition: 4./JG 77, 5./JG 77, 6./JG 77.",
