Personnel and aircraft counts set to placeholder values (1) to satisfy schema requirements, but DO NOT represent actual unit strength.\n\nCRITICAL DATA GAPS:\n- Commander name and rank UNKNOWN\n- Personnel strength UNKNOWN (typical gruppo: 120-180 total)\n- Aircraft strength UNKNOWN (typical gruppo: 20-30 CR.42 fighters)\n- Operational data UNKNOWN (sorties, claims, losses)\n- Base location APPROXIMATE only (Libya - specific airfield unconfirmed)\n- Operations during Operation Compass UNVERIFIED\n\nREQUIRED SOURCES (NOT AVAILABLE):\n1. Shores' Air War for North Africa Vol 1 (1940-1942) - PRIMARY BLOCKER\n2. Italian Comando Supremo records Q4 1940\n3. Asisbiz.com detailed unit page (if well-cited)\n4. RAF Operations Record Books (enemy assessment)\n5.

DEFER this quarter until Shores Vol 1 is acquired\n2. PRIORITIZE 1941-Q4 (better source coverage in Tobruk siege chapter)\n3. ADD to research queue for future source acquisition\n4. DO NOT use this data for wargaming scenarios (insufficient detail)\n\nSee RESEARCH_BRIEF_italian_1940q4_151_gruppo_caccia.md for complete analysis, gap documentation, and research recommendations.\n\nEstimated research time if sources acquired: 4-5 hours for complete extraction.",
