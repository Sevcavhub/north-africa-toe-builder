Kurt Ubben (92 victories when arriving, achieving 110+ total by end of 1942). Aircraft equipped at Munich on 19 Oct 1942 with new Bf 109G-2/Trop fighters. Unit transitioned through Bari, Italy (23-24 Oct) before deploying to Tobruk (26 Oct). First North African victory on 3 Nov 1942 (Hurricane over El Alamein during Ju 87 escort mission). Base sequence in Q4 1942: Tobruk (26 Oct), Gambut, Sidi Barrani, Bir-el-Arca, Martuba, Berca-West, Arco-Philaenorum, Wadi-Tamet, Tauorga (multiple relocations due to Allied advance after El Alamein). Supply situation strained due to Allied air superiority and constant attacks on Luftwaffe bases. Personnel and aircraft numbers based on standard Gruppe establishment (3 staffeln of 12 aircraft each = 36 theoretical, adjusted for operational conditions). Staffel composition: 7./JG 77, 8./JG 77, 9./JG 77. Ubben's 'Wanderzirkus Ubben' (Ubben's Travelling Circus) nickname confirmed by multiple sources. Aircraft primarily Bf 109G-2/Trop (new production from Munich) with small number of transitional Bf 109F-4/Trop aircraft.",
