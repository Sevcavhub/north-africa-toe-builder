During 1942q4, the squadron was heavily engaged in the Second Battle of El Alamein and subsequent Allied advance across Libya. The unit operated tropicalized Spitfire Mk Vb and Vc variants from a series of advancing landing grounds. Squadron demonstrated high operational effectiveness with documented combat successes against Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica. Multiple relocations during the quarter reflect the fluid nature of the campaign following Allied breakthrough at El Alamein. Data quality is Tier 2 (68% complete) - good operational and equipment details but lacking precise strength figures and casualty data which would require primary source access."
