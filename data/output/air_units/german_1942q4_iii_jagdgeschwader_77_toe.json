The unit was re-equipped with tropical Bf 109 G-2/trop fighters in Munich before deployment. Under Hauptmann Kurt Ubben's command, the Gruppe replaced JG 27 in Egypt just as the Second Battle of El Alamein reached its climax. The unit immediately engaged RAF Desert Air Force fighters and fighter-bombers, but faced overwhelming Allied air superiority. On 28 October, 7. Staffel commander Hauptmann Huy shot down a Spitfire near El Alamein but was himself shot down the same day by RAF 601 Squadron and taken prisoner. Following the Axis defeat at El Alamein, III./JG 77 retreated westward through Libya into Tunisia, operating from various temporary desert airfields under constant Allied air attack. By December 1942, the unit was engaged in defensive operations in Tunisia, attempting to intercept Allied fighter-bombers despite severe numerical and logistical disadvantages."
