Aircraft strength significantly degraded by Q4 1942 due to combat losses and mechanical failures. Commander changed from Maj Spangenberg to Hptm Horst Schiller on 1 December 1942. Aircraft transitioned from Ju 87D-1/Trop to newer Ju 87D-3/Trop variants during this quarter. Based at Haggag el Quasaba (Aug-Nov) and Gambut (Nov-Dec). Operational tempo decreased significantly due to Allied air superiority and supply difficulties during the retreat from El Alamein.",
