# Research Brief: No. 94 Squadron SAAF - UNIT DOES NOT EXIST

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Researcher**: Claude Code
**Extraction Request**: No. 94 Squadron SAAF, 1942-Q4
**Result**: EXTRACTION REFUSED - UNIT DOES NOT EXIST

---

## Executive Summary

**No. 94 Squadron SAAF never existed.** The South African Air Force did not operate a squadron with this designation. The confusion likely stems from:

1. **No. 94 Squadron RAF** - A British RAF squadron that operated in North Africa during 1942
2. Potential data entry error in seed file or work queue

---

## Evidence

### 1. Official SAAF Squadron List (Wikipedia - List of Squadrons of SAAF)

**All documented SAAF squadron numbers (1940-1943 era)**:
- Squadrons 1-27, 30, 31, 40, 42 (various states: current, disbanded)
- **NO squadron numbered 94 appears in any SAAF records**

**SAAF squadrons that operated in North Africa 1940-1943**:
- No. 1 Squadron SAAF (extracted)
- No. 2 Squadron SAAF (extracted)
- No. 3 Squadron SAAF
- No. 4 Squadron SAAF (extracted)
- No. 5 Squadron SAAF (extracted)
- No. 7 Squadron SAAF
- No. 12 Squadron SAAF (extracted)
- No. 21 Squadron SAAF (extracted)
- No. 24 Squadron SAAF (extracted)

**Squadron 94 is NOT on this list.**

### 2. No. 94 Squadron RAF (ACTUAL UNIT)

**Designation**: No. 94 Squadron, Royal Air Force (RAF)
**NOT**: South African Air Force

**1942-Q4 Details**:
- **Aircraft**: Hawker Hurricane Mk IIC
- **Base**: El Gamil, Egypt
- **Period at El Gamil**: May 1942 - January 1943
- **Role**: Fighter Squadron, later convoy escort
- **Parent Formation**: RAF Middle East Command
- **Nation**: `british` (RAF, not SAAF)

**Historical Connection to SAAF**:
- In May 1942, No. 94 Squadron RAF transferred Curtiss Kittyhawks to **No. 2 Squadron SAAF**
- This may have caused confusion between the two units

### 3. WITW Airgroup Database Check

**Search Results**: No entry for "No. 94 Squadron SAAF" found in WITW `_airgroup.csv`

**WITW contains**:
- No. 2 SAAF FB Sqn (line 1451)
- No. 4 SAAF FB Sqn (line 1455)
- No. 5 SAAF FB Sqn (line 1456)
- No. 12 SAAF TacB Sqn (line 1619)
- No. 21 SAAF TacB Sqn (line 1625)
- No. 24 SAAF TacB Sqn (line 1626)

**No 94th SAAF squadron appears.**

---

## Conclusion

**Extraction Status**: REFUSED

**Reason**: The unit "No. 94 Squadron SAAF" did not exist. The South African Air Force never operated a squadron with this designation during World War II.

**Likely Confusion**:
- **No. 94 Squadron RAF** (actual unit, operated in North Africa 1942-Q4)
- Data entry error in seed file conflating RAF No. 94 Squadron with SAAF units

---

## Recommendations

1. **Remove "No. 94 Squadron SAAF" from seed data** if present
2. **If RAF squadrons are in scope**, extract as:
   - Unit: No. 94 Squadron RAF (NOT SAAF)
   - Nation: `british`
   - Affiliation: Royal Air Force
3. **Verify seed data source** for other potential RAF/SAAF confusion
