The squadron suffered catastrophic losses during the Gazala battles (May-June 1942), losing four commanding officers including Major John E. Frost, the top SAAF ace. By Q4 1942, the squadron had recovered and participated in the Second Battle of El Alamein and the subsequent Allied advance across Cyrenaica. The squadron was part of No. 233 Wing RAF (alongside Nos. 2 and 4 Squadron SAAF) until 17 December 1942, when transferred to No. 7 SAAF Wing. The Tomahawk Mk.IIB was outclassed by the Bf 109F/G but Allied numerical superiority (4:1 or better) compensated. Squadron converted to Kittyhawk Mk.III in January 1943. Commonwealth forces (British, South African, Australian) formed the backbone of Desert Air Force fighter strength during this period."
