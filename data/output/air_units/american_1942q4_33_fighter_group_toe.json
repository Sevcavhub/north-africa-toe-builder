    "notes": "33rd Fighter Group deployed to North Africa as part of Operation Torch on November 8, 1942, with 77 P-40 aircraft (primarily P-40E models, with P-40F variants arriving during the quarter). The group comprised three squadrons: 58th, 59th, and 60th Fighter Squadrons. On December 6, 1942, the 58th Squadron became the first American air unit stationed in Tunisia at Thelepte Airfield. The group operated under severe logistical constraints during initial deployment, with the 59th Squadron having its aircraft transferred to Free French forces. Specific P-40F serial numbers documented: 41-14315 (59th FS), 41-14270 (nicknamed 'Belchin Bessie'), 41-14378 (nicknamed 'Nomads Dammit'), 42-10578. Personnel and ordnance figures are estimates based on standard USAAF fighter group TO&E for 1942.",
