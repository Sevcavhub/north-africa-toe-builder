Multiple independent sources corroborate Franco Lucchini's role and October 24 shoot-down. However, specific aircraft strength numbers, detailed personnel breakdowns, and ordnance stocks are estimated based on typical Italian fighter gruppo composition with attrition adjustments. Sortie numbers and individual operation claims/losses are reconstructed from general operational tempo descriptions. Qualifies for Tier 2 (review_recommended) with 60-74% Tier 1/2 facts."
