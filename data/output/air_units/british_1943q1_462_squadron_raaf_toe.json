The squadron became non-operational in December 1942 due to severe aircrew shortages and did not resume operations until January 1943. During Q1 1943, the squadron relocated from Solluch (January 18-February 14) to Gardabia Main (February 14 onwards) where it participated in the Tunisian Campaign. Primary missions included attacks on Sicilian harbors and shipping, plus ground support operations. The squadron operated 71 Halifax Mk.II aircraft throughout its Mediterranean service (September 1942-March 1944). Specific aircraft serial numbers mentioned in sources include W7848 (participated in Palermo raid February 5/6, 1943) and W1176.",
