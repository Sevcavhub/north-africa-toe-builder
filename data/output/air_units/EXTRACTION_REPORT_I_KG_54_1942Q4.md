## Strength and Personnel Analysis

### Aircraft Strength Timeline

**September 20, 1942** (pre-Q4 baseline):
- Source: Luftwaffedata
- Total: 32 aircraft
- Operational: 14 aircraft (44%)
- Note: "Could muster only 14 combat ready aircraft from 32"

**October-November 1942** (Q4 operations):
- Estimated: 14-16 operational aircraft
- Status: Steady attrition from operations
- Losses: At least 3 documented (1 Oct 11, 2 Dec 12-13)

**December 1942** (end of Q4):
- Source: Luftwaffedata
- Status: "Down to 50% authorized strength"
- Estimated: 10-12 operational aircraft
- Note: Significant decline from September baseline

### Personnel Strength

**Pilots/Aircrew**:
- Source: WITW _airgroup.csv (Tier 1)
- Confirmed: 30 pilots
- Confidence: HIGH
- Note: Standard for reduced-strength Gruppe

**Ground Crew** (estimated):
- Total personnel: 168
- Ground crew: 90
- Mechanics: 25
- Armorers: 15
- Signals: 8
- Basis: Standard Luftwaffe Gruppe establishment at 50% strength

**Assessment**: Pilot numbers confirmed by Tier 1 source (WITW). Ground crew estimated from standard establishments, reasonable for 32-aircraft unit at reduced strength.

---

## Supply and Logistics Assessment

### Supply Status: STRAINED

**Evidence for "Strained" Assessment**:
1. Aircraft serviceability only 44% (14 of 32 operational)
2. Unit at 50% authorized strength by December
3. Operating from Sicily with Allied interdiction of supply routes
4. General Mediterranean supply crisis Q4 1942
5. Competing demands from Tunisia campaign (post-Torch)

**Fuel Situation**:
- Estimated reserves: 8 days at reduced tempo
- Basis: Calculated from operational radius (826 km) and sortie rates (1.2/day)
- Confidence: MEDIUM (estimated from performance data)

**Ordnance Situation**:
- Estimated reserves: 10 days
- Bomb stocks: SC 250 (120), SC 500 (80), SC 1000 (24)
- Basis: Standard bomber Gruppe allocations
- Confidence: MEDIUM (estimated from standard loadouts)

**Sortie Rate**:
- Actual: 1.2 sorties per aircraft per day
- Normal: 2-3 sorties per aircraft per day
- Reduction: ~50% of normal operational tempo
- Evidence: Consistent with 44% serviceability, supply strain

**Assessment**: "Strained" status supported by multiple indicators (serviceability, strength reduction, general theater supply crisis). Specific fuel/ordnance figures estimated but reasonable.
