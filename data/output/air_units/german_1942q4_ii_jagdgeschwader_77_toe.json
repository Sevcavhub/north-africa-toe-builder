Unit operated Bf 109G-2/Trop aircraft in Tunisia Campaign. Commander Anton Mader was a highly regarded Gruppenkommandeur who prioritized his subordinates' welfare. Ernst-Wilhelm Reinert of II./JG 77 became a leading ace with 51 victories in Mediterranean theater. Unit faced constant Allied air attacks on Tunisian bases. Strength estimates based on standard Luftwaffe Gruppe organization (3 Staffeln + Gruppenstab = ~36-40 aircraft, ~200 personnel). Specific December 1942 aircraft counts, exact personnel breakdown, and detailed ordnance stocks not available in accessible sources - estimates based on organizational standards and operational context. Supply status rated 'strained' due to documented Allied air superiority and constant base attacks mentioned in sources.",
