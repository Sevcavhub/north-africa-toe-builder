Required sources: (1) Christopher Shores 'A History of the Mediterranean Air War 1940-1945, Vol. 2: North African Desert, February 1942 - March 1943' for operational details, aircraft variants, and combat records. (2) UK National Archives AIR 27 Operations Record Book for No. 24 Squadron SAAF (catalogue ref C2502937) for squadron commander, detailed personnel strength, daily operations, sorties, claims, and losses. (3) SAAF Museum official war diaries for unit organization and South African-specific records. Current extraction based on Wikipedia and general web sources establishes unit identification (Douglas Boston III, 24 aircraft, No. 3 Wing SAAF) and operational context (El Alamein, LG.99/Soluch bases) but lacks commander name, specific sortie counts, claims/losses, detailed personnel breakdown, and day-to-day operations. Personnel estimates based on typical Boston squadron organization (3 crew x 24 aircraft = 72 aircrew, plus ~100 ground crew). Ordnance and supply estimates based on Boston III specifications and typical Desert Air Force logistics. Operational radius 525 miles with 2,000lb bomb load per Boston III specs. Tier 1/2 corroboration needed for all quantitative data before achieving Tier 2+ classification.",
