## ESTIMATED DATA (NOT TIER 1/2 CONFIRMED)

The following data is derived from standard Luftwaffe organization tables and reasonable estimates:

### Personnel Numbers
- **Total**: 521 (based on Luftwaffe Orders of Battle standards)
- **Pilots**: 36 (3 staffeln x 12 pilots + staff)

## TIER ASSIGNMENT JUSTIFICATION

### Tier 2 (Review Recommended) - 73% Tier 1/2 Coverage

**STRENGTHS** (High Confidence):
1. ✅ Unit designation confirmed by WITW Tier 1 database
2. ✅ Aircraft variant (Fw 190A-4) confirmed with specific werk numbers
3. ✅ Commander identities confirmed by specialist sources with primary citations
4. ✅ Deployment timeline confirmed by multiple Tier 2 sources
5. ✅ Major combat operations documented with dates
6. ✅ Staffeln composition (4., 5., 6.) confirmed
7. ✅ Bases and operational area confirmed

**MODERATE CONFIDENCE** (Derived from Standards):
1. ⚠️ Personnel numbers based on Luftwaffe TO&E tables (not unit-specific records)
2. ⚠️ Ground equipment estimates based on standard allocations
3. ⚠️ Exact operational strength (40 aircraft, 32 operational) based on typical Gruppe strength

**LOWER CONFIDENCE** (Estimates):
1. ⚠️ Specific ordnance stock quantities (estimates from operational tempo)
2. ⚠️ Detailed daily sortie counts (only major operations documented)
3. ⚠️ Precise fuel/ammunition consumption rates

**MISSING** (Data Gaps):
1. ❌ Complete pilot roster (only commanders and top aces identified)
2. ❌ Daily operational logs (only major actions documented)
3. ❌ Detailed maintenance records
4. ❌ Individual aircraft assignment records beyond documented examples

### Why NOT Tier 1 (75%+ required)?
- Personnel and supply numbers are reasonable estimates, not documented facts
- Missing 2% of Tier 1/2 coverage for production-ready threshold
- Some logistical details derived rather than sourced

### Why NOT Tier 3 (60%+ required)?
- Far exceeds 60% threshold with 73% coverage
- Core facts (unit ID, aircraft, commanders, timeline) all Tier 1/2 confirmed
- Strong specialist source base with primary citations

## NOTABLE FINDINGS

### 1. First Fw 190 Deployment to North Africa
II./JG 2's deployment marked the combat debut of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 in North Africa. This represents a significant historical milestone well-documented in multiple sources.

### 2. Exceptional Pilot Quality
The unit included three future high-scoring aces:
- Kurt Bühligen (final score: 112 victories)
- Erich Rudorffer (final score: 222 victories - 13th highest all-time)
- Adolf Dickfeld (final score: 136 victories)

### 3. Favorable Kill Ratio
Despite numerical inferiority and supply constraints, the unit achieved approximately 150 claims against 9 combat losses over 5 months (November 1942 - March 1943), representing approximately 17:1 kill ratio.

### 4. Brief Command Tenure
Gruppenkommandeur Adolf Dickfeld commanded for only ~7 weeks before his January 8, 1943 injury, limiting his Tunisia score to 5 victories despite his extensive experience (128 previous victories).

## COMPARISON TO GROUND FORCES EXTRACTION

### Similar to Ground Units
- Hybrid protocol validation (Wikipedia + Tier 1/2)
- Tiered confidence system
- Personnel derived from organization tables
- Supply estimates from operational context

### Different from Ground Units
- **Aircraft Specificity**: Exact variants with werk numbers (equivalent to specific tank chassis numbers)
- **Smaller Scale**: ~40 aircraft vs hundreds of vehicles in divisions
- **Higher Mobility**: Frequent base changes vs slower ground movement
- **Source Types**: Aviation specialist sites vs military history archives

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE AIR FORCES EXTRACTIONS

### 1. Source Priority
- Always check WITW _airgroup.csv first (Tier 1 canonical)
- Asisbiz.com is excellent for aircraft-specific details
- FalkeEins blog provides high-quality German unit research
- Aviation specialist forums often have primary source citations

### 2. Aircraft Variant Research
- Never use generic designations ("Bf 109", "Fw 190")
- Always seek specific variants ("Bf 109G-2", "Fw 190A-4")
- Werk numbers provide individual aircraft verification
- Multiple examples strengthen variant confirmation

### 3. Personnel Estimation
- Luftwaffe Orders of Battle September 1942 provides reliable standards
- Fighter Gruppe: 300-515 ground crew, 35-150 aircrew
- Use midpoint estimates for unknown specifics
- Document estimation methodology in metadata

### 4. Supply Assessment
- Mediterranean supply lines were consistently strained
- 8-10 days reserves typical for isolated theaters
- Fuel more critical than ammunition for air units
- Document as "estimated" unless unit records available
