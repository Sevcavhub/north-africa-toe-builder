Unit had TWO commanders during Q4 1942: Hauptmann Kurt Walter (1-26 Oct, KIA when parachute failed) and Major Bernhard Hamester (Oct 1942 - 17 Jun 1943). Unit suffered catastrophic losses during Q4: Oct 26 commander KIA + 2 aircraft, Nov 11 lost 6 aircraft to Allied fighters (possibly P-40s), overall attrition during long retreat from El Alamein through Libya to Tunisia. By 1 Jan 1943 strength reduced to only 21 aircraft (12 Ju 87D-1/Trop + 9 Ju 87D-3/Trop) at Bir Dufan under Fliegerf端hrer Afrika. Multiple base relocations during quarter reflect chaotic retreat: Haggag el Quasaba (Aug-Nov), Gambut (Nov), Nofilia-North Gulf of Sirte (Nov 24), Bir Dufan (late Dec). Personnel and ordnance estimates based on standard Luftwaffe Stuka Gruppe TO&E adjusted for heavy operational attrition. Supply status 'strained' reflects extended retreat, Allied air superiority, supply line collapse. Commander succession validated via multiple Tier 2 sources (Asisbiz.com, Military Wiki). Aircraft variants (Ju 87D-1/Trop, Ju 87D-3/Trop) confirmed via Wikipedia strength report 1 Jan 1943 and technical specifications databases. CRITICAL DISCREPANCY: User requested Gazala/Mersa Matruh operations (May-June 1942, Q2) but requested Q4 extraction (Oct-Dec 1942). Unit WAS present for Gazala in Q2 but this extraction covers Q4 per user specification.
