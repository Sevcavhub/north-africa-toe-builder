For Q4 1942 specifically, the unit was in TRAINING/TRANSIT status - no combat operations occurred during this quarter. Combat operations began in 1943 during Tunisia campaign. Aircraft counts and personnel are estimated based on standard USAAF fighter group TO&E (3 squadrons of 24 aircraft each = 72 total). P-40F and P-40L variants confirmed via Asisbiz serial number records. Squadrons: 314th, 315th, 316th Fighter Squadrons. Unit remained at El Amiriya Dec 1942-Feb 1943 before moving to El Kabrit.",
