Unit underwent significant operational stress during Q4 1942: withdrew to Sardinia Oct 29 for anti-shipping operations under Fliegerkorps X, returned to Tunisia Nov 9, suffered catastrophic losses Nov 11 (8 aircraft to P-40s), continued retreat through Libya (Gambut, Marble Arch, Nofilia), deployed to Tunisia December for Battle of Tebourba. Hauptmann Heinrich Heine commanded throughout this period (Jul 1942 - Apr 1943). Unit reported 29 Ju 87D-3/Trop on 1 Jan 1943, indicating tropicalized variants were standard. Personnel and ordnance estimates based on standard Luftwaffe Stuka Gruppe TO&E adjusted for operational attrition. Supply status 'strained' reflects extended retreat, multiple base relocations (4 bases in 3 months), and Allied air superiority. Source validation: ~65% Tier 1/2 facts (WITW database, Asisbiz.com with citations, TracesOfWar commander dates), ~35% Wikipedia/general sources (operational context, battle dates).
