Squadron flew 800+ total sorties from Idku through January 1943. Minimal enemy contact - only twice were enemy aircraft encountered in Q4 1942. PRIMARY ROLE: Defensive patrol of Suez Canal and Nile Delta rather than front-line combat. UNIT HISTORY: Only Canadian squadron in Desert Air Force. Formed Charmy Down England 27 Nov 1941, known as 'City of Windsor' (adopted May 1943). Deployed Egypt April-June 1942 but no aircraft until midsummer. Re-assembled with Hurricanes 5 Sep 1942 at Shandur. Squadron fully converted to Spitfire Vc by mid-January 1943, then moved west to join Eighth Army in Tunisia for offensive operations (February 1943).
