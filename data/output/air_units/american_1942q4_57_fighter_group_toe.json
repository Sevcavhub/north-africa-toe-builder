Personnel and exact Q4 1942 strength numbers estimated based on USAAF fighter group standard organization (3 squadrons, ~25 aircraft each). Commander Frank H. Mears confirmed until December 20, 1942 when Col Arthur G Salisbury took command. Squadron structure: 64th FS (Black Scorpions), 65th FS, 66th FS. P-40K variant introduced late 1942 as P-40F supplies dwindled. Operations data compiled from multiple sources with emphasis on Battle of El Alamein participation and Western Desert Campaign support.",
