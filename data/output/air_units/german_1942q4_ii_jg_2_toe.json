Commander Adolf Dickfeld was injured in January 1943 and replaced. Notable pilots included Kurt Bühligen (4./JG 2) and Erich Rudorffer (6./JG 2). The unit claimed approximately 150 victories during 5 months in Tunisia before returning to France in March 1943. During 1942-Q4, the unit was based at Sidi Ahmed and participated in escort, ground attack, and air superiority missions. Supply situation was strained due to long Mediterranean supply lines.",

Specialist aviation history sites (Asisbiz, FalkeEins) with documented primary sources provide aircraft variants, commanders, and operational details. Personnel and supply estimates based on standard Luftwaffe Gruppe organization tables (35-150 aircrew, 300-515 ground crew per Luftwaffe Orders of Battle September 1942). Aircraft strength of 40 confirmed by standard Gruppe organization. Ordnance stocks are estimates based on operational tempo. Overall: strong Tier 1/2 corroboration for key facts, with reasonable estimates for logistical details."
