Unit operated exclusively Ju 87R-2/Trop variants - the long-range tropicalized version with underwing drop tanks and desert air filters. Commanded by Obstlt Walter Enneccerus until 18 Oct 1941 (Knight's Cross recipient for earlier operations). Q4 1941 commander not identified in available sources. Unit comprised three staffeln (4., 5., 6./StG 2) operating from Tmimi base west of Tobruk. Participated in Siege of Tobruk operations including successful attack on HMS Waterhen (June 1941) and resisted Operation Crusader (Nov-Dec 1941). No losses reported 15 Jul - 30 Oct 1941 period. Unit redesignated as III./StG 3 on 13 Jan 1942 at San Pancrazio, Italy, ending II./StG 2 designation. Aircraft serials confirmed via Asisbiz: 4./StG 2 (T6+xM codes), 5./StG 2 (T6+xN codes), 6./StG 2 (T6+xP codes). Hubert Polz served as Staffelführer for both 5. and 6. Staffeln (sources unclear on exact dates). Ju 87R-2 specifications: crew 2, max speed 383 km/h, operational radius ~450km with 250kg bomb load, armed with 2× MG 17 forward + 1× MG 15 rear defensive. R-2 variant had internal wing tanks + 2× 300L drop tanks (more than doubling B-2 range) but reduced bomb load to 250kg as wing stations occupied by fuel tanks. Desert tropicalization included air filter and survival equipment. Camouflage: RLM 70/71 European scheme overpainted with Italian Giallo Mimetico or RLM 78/79/80 desert colors.",
