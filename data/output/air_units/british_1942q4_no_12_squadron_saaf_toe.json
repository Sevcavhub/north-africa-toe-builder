Aircraft type, operational dates, parent unit, and battle participation well documented by Tier 2 sources. Personnel, losses, commander, and detailed operational data incomplete. Squadron code requires verification. Overall operational context strong despite gaps in specific details. Recommended for review and potential upgrade to Tier 1 with additional archival research."
