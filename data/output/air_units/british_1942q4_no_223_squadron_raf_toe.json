Personnel numbers estimated from typical RAF light bomber squadron establishment 1942. No specific commander name found in available sources. Operational sortie/loss data not available without ORB access. Aircraft variant mix (Mk III/IIIA) confirmed for June 1942-Oct 1943 timeframe. Base location Amriya confirmed Sept 1942-March 1943. Assignment to 232 Wing confirmed 27 Oct 1942."
