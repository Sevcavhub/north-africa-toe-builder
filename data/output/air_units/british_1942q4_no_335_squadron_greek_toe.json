Became operational 12 February 1942 at El Daba, Egypt. Operated Hurricane Mk I (October 1941-September 1942), transitioned to Hurricane Mk IIB (August 1942-October 1943). Notable operation: 28 October 1942 (second anniversary of Italian invasion of Greece) - 12 Hurricanes under Sqn Ldr Kellas conducted strafing attack on Italian XX Corps HQ during El Alamein, significant morale boost for Greek expatriates. Squadron transitioned from ground attack/escort missions (September-November 1942) to shipping protection role (November 1942 onwards). Personnel were Hellenic Air Force officers trained in Iraq since 1940 plus pilots who escaped Greece after occupation. Squadron moved frequently during Q4 1942 through various Landing Grounds as front lines shifted during and after El Alamein.",

Organizational structure confirmed via web search (27 October 1942: No. 7 SAAF Wing, No. 212 Group, AHQ Western Desert). Commander Ioannis Kellas confirmed via Wikipedia with corroboration from multiple sources (History of War, Military Wiki, Greek biplane fighter pilots website). Notable 28 October 1942 operation confirmed across multiple sources: Wikipedia, History of War, Military Wiki all reference strafing attack on Italian XX Corps HQ. Squadron establishment and personnel numbers estimated based on RAF fighter squadron standards (slightly reduced from 291 to 255 for Greek exile unit).

    "greek_personnel_context": "This was a Greek exile squadron with Hellenic Air Force personnel operating under RAF command structure. All pilots and officers were Greek nationals who had escaped following the German invasion of Greece (April 1941). Personnel included officers trained in Iraq since 1940 under British instructors plus pilots who fled Greece during/after occupation. Ground crew likely mix of Greek personnel and RAF support staff. Squadron maintained Greek identity while integrated into RAF operational structure (squadron codes, reporting chain, tactics). 28 October 1942 operation deliberately scheduled for anniversary of Italian invasion of Greece (28 October 1940) as morale operation for Greek expatriates."
