NO Tier 1 sources (Christopher Shores books, RAF ORBs, National Archives AIR 27 series) or Tier 2 sources (Air Britain, Squadron/Signal, Osprey) were consulted. Commander's full name unknown (only 'Olver' or 'Oliver' found). Personnel numbers are estimates based on typical RAF fighter squadron establishment. Aircraft strength confirmed at 16x Hurricane IIc from multiple sources. Operation Chocolate details partially verified but require primary source corroboration. REQUIRED FOR TIER 2+ UPGRADE: (1) RAF Operations Record Books AIR 27 series for 213 Squadron Oct-Dec 1942, (2) Christopher Shores 'Fighters over the Desert' or 'Mediterranean Air War Vol 2', (3) Official Desert Air Force records for No. 243 Wing composition and operations.",
