Personnel numbers estimated from standard RAF fighter squadron establishment (21 pilots, ~100 ground crew). Combat statistics for Operation Chocolate based on combined 213/238 Squadron claims (300 vehicles, 14 aircraft destroyed, 3 Hurricanes lost from 36 participating). Individual squadron breakdown estimated as proportional. Direct access to Christopher Shores' Mediterranean Air War volumes and RAF ORBs AIR 27/238 would elevate to Tier 1 (production_ready).
