Commander Hauptmann Georg Christl received Knight's Cross on March 18, 1942 for desert operations and German Cross in Gold on December 28, 1942. Unit equipped primarily with Bf 110C-4/Trop and Bf 110E-2/Trop variants, plus small number of Ju 88C-6 night fighters. Heavy losses December 11, 1942: all three escorting Bf 110s shot down by Beaufighters and Spitfires while protecting Ju 52 transport formation. Operational readiness estimated at 57% (16/28) reflecting strained Mediterranean supply situation and combat attrition. Unit transitioned from North African ground attack role to transport escort missions over Sicily-Tunisia route.",
