As a long-range reconnaissance unit (Fernaufklärungsstaffel), it operated Ju 88D-1 variants optimized for photographic and visual reconnaissance missions. Unit strength was minimal in Q1 1941 due to initial deployment phase - only 3 aircraft assigned compared to standard 9-aircraft staffel. Commander name not identified in available sources. Operated from Tripoli-Castel Benito before moving forward with Afrika Korps advance. Aircraft specifications: Ju 88D-1 had 1,100 km operational radius, crew of 4, armed with defensive MG 15 machine guns (7.92mm), maximum speed 470 km/h, equipped with Rb 50/30 and Rb 75/30 cameras.",
