    "notes": "III./ZG 26 was withdrawn to Germany for rest after El Alamein in early October 1942, then returned to North Africa in November 1942 after Operation Torch. The unit operated primarily from Sicily (Trapani) with detachments at Gabes, Tunisia. Aircraft strength estimates based on typical Gruppe establishment (3 Staffeln x 9 aircraft = 27, reduced to ~18 operational due to attrition). Commander name could not be confirmed for Q4 1942 - Hauptmann Vögel mentioned as commander by February 1943 at Trapani. Personnel numbers estimated from standard Zerstörergruppe establishment reduced for combat attrition. Unit equipped primarily with older Bf 110C-4 variants with some newer F-2 models arriving. Heavy losses sustained in December 1942 to Allied fighters (P-38 Lightning, Spitfire, Beaufighter). By 31 December 1941, III./ZG 26 had flown 2,962 sorties in North Africa total.",
