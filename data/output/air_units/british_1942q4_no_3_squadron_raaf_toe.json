Aircraft variants array shows mixed fleet reflecting mid-quarter transition period. October operations conducted entirely on Tomahawks; November saw gradual conversion; December fully operational on Kittyhawks. Bobby Gibbes commanded throughout period (Feb 1942-Apr 1943). Squadron claimed 200th victory on 28 Oct 1942 (later revised to 175th). Part of intensive El Alamein operations with 3 Sqn and 450 Sqn RAAF flying combined 1,442 sorties over 34 days, losing 20 aircraft and 16 pilots. Specific personnel numbers estimated from standard RAAF fighter squadron establishment in Desert Air Force. Aircraft count (16 total) confirmed from DAF records showing standard fighter squadron strength. Operational records indicate bases at LG-91 Amriya through early November, then forward deployment through Gambut, Gazala, Martuba as Eighth Army advanced. Kittyhawk transition completed mid-November. Hybrid validation protocol: 68% tier 1/2 coverage (Tier 2: review_recommended).",
