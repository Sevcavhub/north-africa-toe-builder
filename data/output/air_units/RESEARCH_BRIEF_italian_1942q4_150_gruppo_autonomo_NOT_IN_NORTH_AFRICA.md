### Wikipedia Usage (Per Hybrid Protocol)
- ✅ Wikipedia used for: Unit identification, battle list, operational context
- ✅ Tier 2 corroboration obtained for: Departure date, aircraft types, squadron numbers
- ✅ Validation passed: YES (for North Africa service January-July 1942)
- ❌ Validation FAILED: Unit NOT in North Africa during 1942-Q4

---

## Hybrid Source Validation Verdict

### Protocol Compliance
✅ **Wikipedia ALLOWED** for unit identification
✅ **Tier 2 corroboration REQUIRED** for extraction (60% minimum)
✅ **Specific aircraft variants REQUIRED** from Tier 1/2

### Validation Results
- **Unit Identification**: ✅ Confirmed (150° Gruppo Autonomo CT)
- **Tier 2 Facts Confirmed**: ✅ 85-90% (squadron numbers, aircraft types, commanders)
- **Timeline Verification**: ❌ **FAILED** - Unit NOT in North Africa during 1942-Q4
- **Extraction Decision**: ❌ **REFUSED**

### Tier Assignment (If extraction were appropriate)
Based on available data for **January-July 1942 period**:
- **Tier 2 (review_recommended)**: 60-74% Tier 1/2 facts confirmed
- Multiple aircraft variants confirmed (MC.200, MC.202)
- Commander names, squadron numbers, bases documented
- BUT: Specific MC.202 series variants NOT confirmed (would require research)

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Correct Seed Data
**File**: `projects/north_africa_seed_units_COMPLETE.json`

**Issue**: Seed data incorrectly lists 150° Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre for 1942-Q4.

**Correction**:
- If unit should remain in seed data, correct quarter to **1942-Q2** (April-June 1942)
- OR document that unit is OUT OF SCOPE (left theater before Q4)
- OR replace with units actually present at El Alamein (see list above)

### 2. Alternative Units for 1942-Q4 Extraction
If seeking Italian fighter gruppo for 1942-Q4, consider:
- **6° Gruppo** (MC.202 Folgore, Martuba) - Major Marco Larcher
- **17° Gruppo** (MC.202 Folgore) - Major Bruno Brambilla
- **12° Gruppo Autonomo CT** (G.50 Freccia, Castel Benito) - Lieutenant Colonel Bruno Cudugnello
- **160° Gruppo Autonomo CT** (G.50 Freccia, Sorman) - Major Michele Mandara

### 3. If 150° Gruppo Extraction Desired
**Valid Quarters**:
- ✅ **1941-Q1**: Albania/Greece operations (March 1941)
- ✅ **1942-Q1**: North Africa (January-March 1942)
- ✅ **1942-Q2**: North Africa (April-June 1942)
- ✅ **1942-Q3**: Sicily/Italy (July-September 1942) - IF Sicily theater in scope
- ❌ **1942-Q4**: Sicily/Italy (October-December 1942) - OUT OF NORTH AFRICA SCOPE

---

## Conclusion

**EXTRACTION STATUS**: ❌ **REFUSED**

**Reason**: Unit departed North Africa on **July 22, 1942**, three months before the requested extraction quarter (1942-Q4). The 150° Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre was stationed in Sicily and mainland Italy during October-December 1942, conducting homeland defense operations, NOT North Africa combat operations.

**Evidence Quality**: High (Tier 2 sources, 85-90% confidence)

**Recommendation**: Correct seed data or select alternative Italian fighter gruppo actually present during El Alamein period (October-November 1942).
