Billy Drake's mount, ET789 GA-C, AK772 GA-Y 'London Pride'). Squadron moved multiple times during El Alamein and subsequent pursuit operations. Billy Drake succeeded Clive Caldwell (highest-scoring Australian ace) as CO in May 1942. Personnel included pilots from Poland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand. Squadron used Kittyhawks as fighter-bombers for remainder of Desert Air Force operations.",
