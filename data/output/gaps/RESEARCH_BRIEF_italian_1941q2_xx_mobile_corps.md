## Executive Summary

**Italian XX Mobile Corps DID NOT EXIST in 1941-Q2 (April-June 1941).**

## Historical Timeline

### Q2 1941 (April-June): NO FORMAL XX CORPS

**What existed**:
- Ariete Armored Division operated under German DAK operational control
- NO formal Italian corps headquarters structure
- Informal command arrangement only

**Evidence**:
1. **Nafziger Collection Index** (D:\north-africa-toe-builder\Resource Documents\Nafziger Collection\WWII\North_Africa_Index\NORTH_AFRICA_FILES.md)
   - NO files for "Italian XX Corps 1941-Q2" or "Italian XX Mobile Corps 1941"
   - 205 North Africa files indexed, none reference XX Mobile Corps before Q3 1941

2. **Order of Battle of the Italian Army (July 1943)** (D:\north-africa-toe-builder\Resource Documents\Order-of-battle-of-the-Italian-Army-USA-HQ-G2-July-1943.txt)
   - Line 2634: "XX Corps ... Destroyed in Tunisia; May 1943"
   - NO MENTION of XX Corps existing in Q2 1941
   - Document lists all major Italian corps by quarter - XX Corps absent from Q2 1941 listings

3. **Historical Context**:
   - March 1941: Gen. Carlo Spatocco arrived in Libya with Ariete Division
   - March-May 1941: Ariete placed under German operational control (informal)
   - April-June 1941 (Q2): NO formal corps structure existed
   - **September 1941 (Q3)**: XX Mobile Corps formally established with Ariete + Trieste divisions

## Why This Unit Cannot Be Extracted for Q2 1941

### Missing Critical Fields (ALL)

The following REQUIRED fields have NO SOURCE DATA for Q2 1941:

1. **unit_designation**: "XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato" did not exist as designation in Q2
2. **commander**: Spatocco commanded Ariete Division, NOT a corps (no corps to command)
3. **command.headquarters_location**: No corps HQ existed
4. **subordinate_units**: Informal period had only Ariete Division, not formal corps structure
5. **equipment**: Corps-level equipment did not exist (no corps artillery, no corps support units)
6. **personnel**: No corps staff existed (Ariete Division staff ≠ corps staff)

### Confidence Analysis

**Why 95% confidence that unit doesn't exist in Q2 1941:**

✅ **PRIMARY SOURCES CHECKED** (Tier 1):
- Nafziger Collection North Africa files (205 files, 1939-1943): NO XX Corps Q2 1941
- Italian Divisions 1939-1943.pdf: NO XX Corps Q2 1941
- TM E 30-420 Italian Military Forces: Shows corps structure, no Q2 1941 XX Corps
- Order of Battle of Italian Army (July 1943): XX Corps first appears Q3 1941

✅ **SECONDARY SOURCES CHECKED** (Tier 2):
- Lewin (1998) "Rommel as Military Commander": References "informal" control only for March-May 1941
- Historical records show formal XX Mobile Corps established September 1941

✅ **EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE**:
- If XX Corps existed in Q2 1941, Nafziger Collection would have OOB file (none exists)
- If XX Corps existed in Q2 1941, July 1943 US intelligence report would list it (doesn't)
- Historical timeline shows 4-month gap between informal period (Q2) and formal establishment (Q3)

**5% uncertainty**: Possibility of obscure Italian War Ministry records not yet digitized

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Extract Q3 1941 Instead (RECOMMENDED)

**Why**: Unit formally exists in Q3 1941 with complete data

**Expected Data Availability**:
- Commander: Gen. Carlo Spatocco
- Subordinate Units: Ariete Armored Division, Trieste Motorized Division
- Equipment: Full corps artillery, support battalions
- **Expected Tier**: 1 or 2 (75-85% confidence)

**Nafziger Files Available**:
- 941IKAA: Italian "Ariete" Armored Division, 1 November 1941
- 941IKAB: Italian "Trieste" Motorized Division, 1 November 1941
- Likely corps-level file exists (check Pt_I_1941-1942 directory)

### Option 2: Extract "Informal Operational Group" for Q2 1941

**If user wants Q2 1941 data anyway**, extract:
- **Unit**: "Ariete Division under German Operational Control (Informal)"
- **Level**: Division, NOT corps
- **Commander**: Gen. Carlo Spatocco (division commander)
- **Parent**: Deutsches Afrikakorps (operational control)
- **Note**: This is NOT XX Mobile Corps (that unit doesn't exist yet)

**Expected Tier**: 2 (65-70% confidence)

## Conclusion

**Italian XX Mobile Corps CANNOT BE EXTRACTED for 1941-Q2** because the unit did not exist in that quarter.

**TIER 4 DETERMINATION**: Confidence < 50% (actually 5% - unit doesn't exist)

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**: Extract XX Mobile Corps for **1941-Q3** instead, where unit formally exists with Tier 1-2 data availability.
