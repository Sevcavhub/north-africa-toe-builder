Q2 1941 estimates based on 'practically destroyed' status requiring significant reduction from authorized strength. Tier 2 research (Military Wiki, TheReaderWiki, The Crusader Project, Warfare History Network) provided detailed operational history including Battle of Beda Fomm destruction (Feb 1941), coastal defense assignment at Al Khums (Feb-Apr), and redeployment to Gharyan-Nalut defensive sector (May-June) for rebuilding. Overall 78% confidence reflects solid source documentation of unit identity/composition from Tier 1 US primary sources, enhanced operational history detail from Tier 2 curated sources, though commander name unavailable and equipment/personnel numbers remain estimated due to understrength status during Q2 1941 rebuilding period."

    "notes": "60ª Divisione Sabratha Q2 1941 extraction using v3.0.0 schema. Division practically destroyed during Operation Compass (Dec 1940-Feb 1941), particularly Battle of Beda Fomm (Feb 6-7, 1941). Q2 1941 represents rebuilding phase with division severely understrength (~54% personnel, ~40% artillery, ~50% vehicles). Commander: Unknown - US G-2 primary source document shows blank commander field for this period. Composition verified from Tier 1 US sources: 85º & 86º Reggimenti Verona (infantry), 42º Reggimento/Artillery Grouping Sabratha (artillery - destroyed at Beda Fomm, replaced by grouping with CCLXXXII and CCLXXXIV groups). Division non-operational for offensive operations during this quarter, assigned to Gharyan-Nalut defensive sector for reconstitution. Reformed to combat effectiveness in 1942 per US G-2 document. Supply/logistics data (fuel 3 days, ammo 5 days, operational radius 150km) reflects low priority for non-operational rebuilding division. Weather/environment data for Q2 1941 North Africa (18-38°C, rocky desert plateau terrain). Data confidence 78% based on verified Tier 1 US primary sources (unit composition, history) combined with Tier 2 curated sources (operational details, reconstitution timeline)."
