    "quarterly_assessment": "Q2 1941 recovery and rebuilding phase after Operation Compass losses (February 1941). Tank strength increased from ~75-85 M13/40 in April to 99+ by June through VII Battalion (4 March) and VIII Battalion (22 June) arrivals. Operational readiness improved 60-70% (April) to 75-80% (June). Major operations: Cyrenaica reconquest (March-April), Tobruk assaults (April - hampered by sand filters; May - successful penetration of 5 strongpoints), Operation Battleaxe defense (June). Personnel remained understrength ~6,500-7,000 vs 9,274 authorized. M13/40 vulnerable to Matilda II but adequate vs lighter British armor. Primary Italian armored reserve crucial for siege operations and countering British relief attempts."
