## Supply Status

| Resource | Status | Days on Hand |

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Infantry Division - general purpose infantry formation for offensive and defensive operations

### Strengths

- Territorial Army division with high unit cohesion from regional recruitment (Northumbria)
- Experienced cadre from BEF France 1940 (Dunkirk veterans)
- Trained for both European and desert warfare
- Strong artillery support with 72 x 25-pdr field guns

### Weaknesses

- 2-pounder anti-tank gun inadequate against later German armor (Panzer III/IV with improved armor)
- Lack of organic armored support - dependent on attachment of tank brigades
- Motor transport mix from multiple sources creating maintenance challenges
- Green troops in desert conditions during Q2 1941 - acclimatization ongoing

**Desert Adaptations:** Water tanker allocation increased for desert operations,Vehicle maintenance enhanced for sand conditions,Desert navigation training conducted during Egypt deployment,Supply lines extended for dispersed desert warfare

## Critical Equipment Shortages

No critical equipment shortages identified for this quarter.

## Historical Context

### Historical Engagements

- Battle of Gazala (May-June 1942)
- Defense of Tobruk (Captured June 1942 - division's low point)
- First Battle of El Alamein (July 1942)
- Second Battle of El Alamein (October-November 1942)

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 7/10 |
| **Experience** | Regular |

### Special Rules

- Territorial Army Cohesion: +1 morale when units from same brigade fight together
- Desert Inexperience (Q2 1941 only): -1 to desert movement and navigation
- Strong Artillery: 72 x 25-pdr provides excellent fire support
- Limited Anti-Tank: 2-pdr inadequate vs medium/heavy armor in 1942+

### Scenario Suitability

- 1942 Gazala Battles
- 1942 First Battle of El Alamein
- 1942 Second Battle of El Alamein
- 1944 Normandy Campaign (later deployment)
