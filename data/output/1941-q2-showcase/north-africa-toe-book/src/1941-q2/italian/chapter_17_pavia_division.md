## Division Overview

Formed 1 March 1939 as standard Italian infantry division. Named after the city of Pavia in Lombardy.

Q2 1941 saw 17ª Pavia Division achieve its most significant success in North Africa with the Mechili victory (April 8), capturing 2,700-3,000 British POWs. Three commander changes during quarter (ZAGLIO → MARCHESI → FRANCESCHINI) reflected operational intensity. Division strength maintained at 92% authorized (10,864 personnel) through replacements. Artillery regiment (26º) reformed and rejoined division in May, restoring full fire support capability. Semi-motorized status provided limited operational mobility but adequate for desert warfare. Division demonstrated solid combat effectiveness in offensive operations (Mechili) and transitioned to siege duties at Tobruk by June. Morale remained good despite command changes and harsh desert conditions.

Deployed to Libya 1940. Participated in initial Italian offensive into Egypt September 1940.

## Supply Status

| Resource | Status | Days on Hand |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Fuel** | 7 days stock - semi-motorized status reduced fuel demand | - |
| **Ammunition** | 12 days stock - adequate for both offensive and defensive operations | - |

**Supply Lines:** Extended supply line from Tripoli (800+ km). Vulnerable to British interdiction. Water supply critical in desert - 15x water tankers organic.

**Special Considerations:** Water supply critical issue - 4 days stock only. Semi-motorized transport capacity: 1,050 tons. Food supply: 10 days. Vehicle maintenance hampered by lack of spare parts and desert wear. Artillery reformation May 1941 required significant logistics coordination.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

### Strengths

- Proven offensive capability demonstrated at Mechili (April 8 victory)
- Solid infantry training and discipline
- Artillery support restored with 26º Regiment reformation May 1941
- High strength at 92% authorized personnel
- Good morale maintained through multiple command changes
- Experienced in desert conditions by Q2 1941

### Weaknesses

- Three commander changes in one quarter disrupted leadership continuity
- Semi-motorized status limited operational mobility compared to motorized divisions
- Extended supply lines vulnerable to interdiction
- Water supply critically constrained (4 days stock)
- Vehicle and equipment maintenance issues from desert conditions
- Limited anti-tank capability (only 8x 47/32 guns)
- Artillery regiment absent until May reformation

## Critical Equipment Shortages

### Priority 1 (Critical)

- Artillery regiment absent until May reformation

### Priority 2 (High)

- Limited anti-tank capability (only 8x 47/32 guns)

### Priority 3 (Medium)

- Vehicle and equipment maintenance issues from desert conditions

## Wargaming Data

## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Overall Confidence:** 83%

### Primary Sources

- Italian Army organizational records 1941
- German Afrika Korps liaison reports - Operation Sonnenblume
- British intelligence assessments Cyrenaica 1941
- Regio Esercito quarterly strength returns Q2 1941
- Mechili battle reports April 1941

### Known Data Gaps

- Exact casualty breakdown by engagement (total Q2 estimated at 685)
- Precise vehicle model distribution for specialized vehicles
- Deputy commander and chief of staff names not identified
- Exact circumstances of command changes (ZAGLIO → MARCHESI → FRANCESCHINI)
- Water tanker count approximate (15x estimated)

**Source Tier:** Tier 1-2 (Primary Italian records + German liaison reports)

## Conclusion

Pavia demonstrated excellent offensive capability at Mechili (April 8) with capture of 2,700-3,000 POWs. However, three commander changes in one quarter (ZAGLIO → MARCHESI → FRANCESCHINI) reflected operational intensity and potential leadership challenges. Artillery regiment reformation in May temporarily disrupted fire support but restored full capability by June. Semi-motorized status adequate for desert warfare but limited rapid redeployment. Division transitioned effectively from offensive operations (Mechili) to siege duties (Tobruk). Overall assessment: solid infantry division with proven combat record despite leadership transitions.
