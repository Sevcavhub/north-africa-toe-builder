## Division Overview

Formed 1 March 1937 in Libya as standard Italian colonial infantry division. Named after ancient Roman city of Sabratha in Tripolitania. Permanently stationed in Libya.

Q2 1941 was a recovery period for 60ª Sabratha Division following near-annihilation during British Operation Compass. Division suffered catastrophic losses at Beda Fomm in February 1941 when attempting to retreat from Cyrenaica. Commander Generale Della Bona ordered withdrawal to defensive positions Derna-Mechili sector. Division spent Q2 1941 reconstituting with whatever personnel and equipment could be spared. Many battalions existed as companies, companies as platoons. Artillery particularly depleted - 42º Reggimento reduced to approximately 18 guns vs authorized 48. Transport losses severe, impacting mobility. Division classified as 'non-operational' for offensive operations during this quarter. Morale reportedly low due to defeats and material shortages. Division would not return to effective combat strength until major reconstitution efforts in 1942.

Formed in theater. Participated in Italian offensive into Egypt September 1940.

## Organizational Structure

### Subordinate Units

   - Type: infantry_regiment
   - Notes: Home station Caserta. Standard Italian infantry regiment with three battalions (reduced strength Q2 1941)

2. **86º Reggimento fanteria "Verona"**
   - Type: infantry_regiment
   - Notes: Standard Italian infantry regiment with three battalions (reduced strength Q2 1941)

3. **42º Reggimento artiglieria "Sabratha"**
   - Type: artillery_regiment
   - Notes: Division artillery regiment. Equipped with 100/17 howitzers and 75/27 field guns. Severely depleted Q2 1941.

4. **LX Battaglione misto del genio**
   - Type: engineer_battalion
   - Notes: Divisional engineer battalion (mixed combat and construction)

5. **LX Compagnia Trasmissioni**

   - Type: medical_company
   - Notes: Divisional medical section

7. **Servizi Logistici**
   - Type: logistics_battalion
   - Notes: Supply, transport, and maintenance services (greatly reduced Q2 1941)

## Supply Status

| Resource | Status | Days on Hand |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Fuel** | Low - limited fuel allocation for non-operational division | - |
| **Ammunition** | Basic stocks only | - |

**Supply Lines:** Extended supply line from Tripoli (600+ km). Division low priority for supplies during rebuilding.

**Special Considerations:** Sabratha Division received lowest supply priority in Q2 1941 as operational divisions (Brescia, Bologna, Pavia) prioritized for Tobruk siege. Water supply adequate in coastal Derna sector. Vehicle maintenance nearly impossible due to lack of replacement vehicles and parts. Artillery ammunition restricted to basic defensive loads. Division essentially 'mothballed' pending future reconstitution.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

### Strengths

- Cadre of experienced officers and NCOs survived Operation Compass
- Coastal defensive position in Derna sector required less mobility
- Division designation and regimental traditions maintained for future rebuilding
- Some combat experience in survivors

### Weaknesses

- Personnel at only 54% authorized strength
- Artillery reduced to ~40% authorized strength (18 vs 48 guns)
- Transport severely depleted making division essentially immobile
- Morale reportedly low following defeats and losses
- Many units exist as cadres only, not combat-effective formations
- Equipment shortages across all categories
- Classified non-operational for offensive operations

## Critical Equipment Shortages

### Priority 1 (Critical)

- Personnel deficit: 46% below authorized strength
- Artillery reduced to ~40% authorized strength (18 vs 48 guns)

## Historical Context

### Major Operations (Q2 1941)

**Reconstitution and Reorganization** (1941-04-01 to 1941-06-30)
- Role: Rebuilding and limited defensive duties
- Outcome: Division partially reconstituted but remained severely understrength
- Casualties: Minimal - limited combat operations
- Division spent Q2 1941 recovering from near-destruction during Operation Compass (Dec 1940-Feb 1941). Battle of Beda Fomm (6-7 Feb 1941) resulted in catastrophic losses. Ordered to fall back to Derna-Mechili sector. Division existed largely as cadre during Q2 1941 with many units at battalion/company strength only. Absorbed replacements when available but priority went to other divisions.

- Precise artillery composition and numbers - estimated 18 guns from reduction percentage
- Detailed vehicle holdings - estimated from reduced strength calculations

- Precise deployment location within Derna-Mechili sector
- Detailed timeline of reconstitution efforts

**Source Tier:** Mixed Tier 1 (US primary documents) and Tier 2 (curated web sources - detailed Q2 1941 research)

## Conclusion

60ª Sabratha Division in Q2 1941 represents Italian Army's challenges in North Africa: inadequate logistics, chronic equipment shortages, and difficulty recovering from major defeats. Division suffered catastrophic losses at Beda Fomm and spent Q2 1941 as 'shell division' - maintaining organizational structure but lacking combat capability. Would require extensive rebuilding to return to operational status. US G2 document confirms division 'practically destroyed in 1940-41' and only 'reformed' in 1942 for renewed operations. This Q2 1941 snapshot captures division at its nadir between destruction and eventual reconstitution.
