# Re-Extraction Plan: 9 Wikipedia-Affected Divisions

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Session**: v3.0.0 schema compliance
**Purpose**: Rebuild 9 divisions with proper Tier 1/2 sources (no Wikipedia)

---

## Overview

After removing 26 Wikipedia citations from 9 divisions, we need to **re-extract** these units using only authorized Tier 1/2 sources. This ensures data quality and v3.0 compliance.

**Backup Location**: `data/output/1941-q2-showcase/wikipedia_versions/` (original files preserved)

**Reference**: See `WIKIPEDIA_VIOLATIONS_REFERENCE.md` for trace paths to primary sources

2. **ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ 1st South African Division** - 5 citations removed
3. **ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Ariete Division** - 4 citations removed

### Priority 2: Medium Dependence (2-3 citations removed)

## Agent Workflow for Each Division

### Phase 1: Document Parsing
**Agent**: `document_parser` v2.0.0

**Input**:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "document_parser",
  "task_id": "parse_[nation]_[unit]_q2_1941",
  "inputs": {
    "nation": "[german|italian|british]",
    "quarter": "1941-Q2",
    "unit_designation": "[Full unit name]",
    "unit_type": "[division|corps]",
    "source_documents": ["[Tier 1 source paths]"],
    "source_tier": "tier_1"
  }
}
```

**Expected Output**:
- Raw unit data extracted from Tier 1 sources
- Commander information with appointment dates
- Brigade/regiment structure
- Equipment holdings (tanks, artillery, vehicles)
- **NO Wikipedia sources in validation.source array**

### Phase 2: Historical Research

  "inputs": {
    "nation": "[german|italian|british]",
    "quarter": "1941-Q2",
    "unit_designation": "[Full unit name]",
    "parsed_data": "[Output from document_parser]",
    "research_questions": [
      "Operational history Q2 1941",

    ],
    "allowed_sources": ["tier_1", "tier_2"],
    "forbidden_sources": ["wikipedia", "wikia", "fandom", "military_wiki"]
  }
}
```

**Expected Output**:

### Phase 3: Validation & Consolidation
**Agent**: `schema_validator` v2.0.0

**Input**:
- Parsed document data
- Historical research data

**Validation Checks**:
1. Schema v3.0.0 compliance (supply_logistics, weather_environment)

## Execution Plan

### Approach 1: Autonomous Agent Execution (Recommended)
```bash
npm run start:autonomous
```

Then launch 9 parallel agent tasks for each division using Claude Code Task tool:

**Example for 5th Indian Division**:
```
Use Task tool with general-purpose agent:

"Extract 5th Indian Infantry Division TO&E for 1941-Q2 using ONLY Tier 1/2 sources.

FORBIDDEN: Wikipedia, Military Wiki, Fandom, Wikia

REQUIRED TIER 1 SOURCES:
- Indian Army Lists Q2 1941
- War Diaries: 5th Indian Division
- Battle of Keren after-action reports

TIER 2 ALLOWED:
- Imperial War Museum East African Campaign
- HyperWar East African Campaign Chapter 9

EXTRACT:
- Unit identification (designation, type, quarter)
- Command (commander, staff, HQ location)
- Personnel strength (officers, NCOs, enlisted)
- Equipment (artillery, vehicles, small arms)
- Subordinate units (9th, 10th, 29th Brigades)
- Operational history Q2 1941 (East Africa Campaign)
- Tactical doctrine and combat effectiveness
- Supply status

OUTPUT: Complete unit JSON following unified_toe_schema.json v3.0.0

TARGET CONFIDENCE: 85%+

Verify NO Wikipedia sources in validation.source array."
```

### Approach 2: Manual Extraction (Slower but More Control)
```bash
npm run start:claude
```

Generate prompts for each division, process manually one by one.

---

## Success Criteria

### Per Division
- âœ… Schema v3.0.0 compliant
- âœ… Confidence â‰¥75% (target 85%+)
- âœ… NO Wikipedia sources in validation.source
- âœ… All required sections present and populated
- âœ… Equipment totals validated
- âœ… Operational history specific to Q2 1941

### Overall Project
- âœ… All 9 divisions re-extracted with Tier 1/2 sources
- âœ… Bologna & Trieste Division Overview sections filled
- âœ… All 18 showcase chapters v3.0 compliant
- âœ… 100% pass rate on `npm run validate:sources`
- âœ… Average confidence 82%+ across all divisions

---

## Timeline Estimate

### Parallel Execution (Recommended)
- **Setup**: 15 minutes (agent configuration)
- **Extraction**: 2-3 hours (9 divisions in parallel batches of 3)
- **Validation**: 30 minutes (schema + sources check)
- **Chapter Regeneration**: 10 minutes
- **Total**: ~3-4 hours

### Sequential Execution
- **Per Division**: 20-30 minutes
- **Total**: 3-4.5 hours (9 divisions Ã— 20-30 min)

---

## Post-Extraction Tasks

1. **Validate All Units**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:v3 data/output/1941-q2-showcase/consolidated_units/*.json
   npm run validate:sources data/output/1941-q2-showcase/consolidated_units/
   ```

2. **Regenerate MDBook Chapters**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate_mdbook_chapters.js
   ```

3. **Compare with Wikipedia Versions**:
   ```bash
   # Diff confidence scores
   # Verify data quality improvements
   # Document any data gaps filled
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`
   - Create `RE-EXTRACTION_COMPLETE.md` report
   - Update `SHOWCASE_GAPS.md` with resolved items

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Tessin Sources Not Accessible (German units)
**Mitigation**:
- Extract .gz compressed files first
- If still inaccessible, use Tier 2 (Feldgrau, Lexikon der Wehrmacht)
- Accept 75% confidence minimum for German units until Tessin accessible

### Risk: Tier 1 Sources Missing Key Data
**Mitigation**:
- Escalate to Tier 2 per source_waterfall.js logic
- Document data gaps in validation.known_gaps
- Flag for future enhancement when better sources available

### Risk: Confidence Scores Below 75%
**Mitigation**:
- Cross-reference multiple Tier 2 sources
- Use interpolation from adjacent quarters (Q1, Q3)
- Document assumptions in validation.assumptions_made

---

**Document Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for execution
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13
**Next Action**: Execute re-extraction for 9 divisions using agents
