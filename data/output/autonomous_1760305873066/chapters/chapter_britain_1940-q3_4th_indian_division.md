## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Infantry division preparing for offensive operations in Western Desert. Combat-ready by end of October 1940. Reinforced with attached British 16th Infantry Brigade from 9 September 1940.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Fully trained and equipped for desert warfare by October 1940
- Experienced divisional artillery commander now leading division
- Mixed British and Indian battalions at brigade level
- Reinforced with additional British infantry brigade

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Desert warfare training complete - ready for offensive operations
- Integration of attached British brigade into divisional structure
- Artillery coordination under combat-experienced commander

**Known Issues**:
- No organic tank support - dependent on British armored units
- Limited anti-aircraft defenses
- Under-mechanized compared to German formations

**Desert Adaptations**: Division declared combat-ready by end of October 1940. Training focused on offensive operations in preparation for Operation Compass. Italian invasion of Egypt (13 September 1940) increased operational tempo.
