Artillery

The Royal Artillery was arguably the most professional arm in Eighth Army
during World War II, which initially bore responsibility for providing both
anti-tank defence and indirect fire support. Indeed, the artillery was the British
arm of service the Germans most feared and respected.

The high-velocity Royal Ordnance QF 2-pdr anti-tank gun of 40mm calibre
(capable of firing an AP round) was the main gun equipping Royal Artillery and
other Commonwealth anti-tank regiments in Western Desert Force and Eighth
Army for destroying enemy AFVs. Early in 1942 it was issued to infantry units.
With an innovative three-legged mounting that could be quickly folded down
to form a pedestal base, this handy, lightweight, towed gun had a very low
silhouette and could easily swing 360 degrees to point in any direction. Others
were carried ‘portee’ on the back of flat-bed lorries, enabling them to come into
action far more quickly, but these soft-skin vehicles were difficult to conceal
and extremely vulnerable to enemy action. With a muzzle velocity of 2,650
ft/sec and excellent sights, its AP round could penetrate 50mm of armour plate
at 500 yards and 40mm at 1,000 yards. Although when issued in 1936 it was
a state-of-the-art weapon and performed well when used in close country in
North-West Europe in 1940, its limitations soon became clear in the Western
Desert when used against increasingly better-armoured enemy tanks in open
terrain at long range. Dubbed by one senior officer as a ‘pernicious pop-gun’
the 2-pdr proved incapable of defeating the frontal armour on most German
AFVs after they were up-armoured in 1941-42; the bolted-on or welded
face-hardened armour caused a 2-pdr round to break up on impact. Even so it
could still penetrate the turret, sides and rear of German AFVs, but this required
careful tactical handling. Despite its recognized shortcomings the 2-pdr,
however, was retained in service for a year after becoming obsolete, since the
production of its planned replacement was deliberately delayed, given the
urgent need to manufacture large numbers of weapons to re-equip the BEF
following Dunkirk.

The far more effective and long-awaited QF 6-pdr anti-tank gun, superior in
performance to the German SOmm PAK, only became available in April/May

Two Stuart tanks advancing in the
Western Desert, 18 June 1942. The
Stuart or Honey Light Tank was an
AFV of US design (the M3) that
came into British service in North
Africa just before Operation
Crusader in November 1941. Unlike
contemporary British tanks it was
fast and mechanically reliable,
earning a nickname of Honey from
its crews, but had a short range of
only 40 miles before needing a refill
The Stuart proved an extremely
versatile light tank, but its 37mm
main gun and coaxial machine gun
had limited effectiveness against
increasingly better armoured enemy
tanks, and it quickly proved too
lightly armoured to survive in
tank-versus-tank engagements.

Desert, 8 March 1942, (4700-32

25epdr field guns in action in the
Western Desert, 22 March 1942.
‘The 25-pdr gun/howitzer was
arguably one of the best artillery
pieces to see service with the Royal
Artillery. With a range of 13,400
yards, and easy to handle in action,
it provided effective indirect fire
support to the infantry and formed
the mainstay of Field Artillery
regiments through World War Il
This highly effective field piece was
capable of firing a wide range of
ammunition, including white and
coloured smoke, fare, incendiary,
propaganda and squash-head shells,
as well the normal HE, shrapnel and
AP shot. It was heavily employed
during the opening rounds of the
Desert War as an anti-tank weapon
firing a solid 20 Ib. AP shot, given
the shortcomings of the 2-pdr
anti-tank gun. (4700-32 E 9535)

1942 in sufficient quantities to make an impact on the battlefield, when 112
guns were issued to motor infantry battalions and RA anti-tank regiments in
armoured divisions. This 57mm gun ~ a highly effective compromise between
firepower and lightness — was towed into battle, and had a split trail and shield
to protect its crew. With greater armour penetration than its predecessors -
60-140mm at 1,000 yards - it could engage German AFVs at longer ranges with
a far better chance of achieving a kill. It could fire anti-tank rounds, and later
an HE anti-personnel shell was produced. Lack of a good sight and opportunity
for training, however, initially limited effectiveness, but the action at SNIPE
at El Alamein showed when well handled how effective these guns could be
against Axis armour,

The 6-pdrs and those 2-pdrs remaining in service were supplemented by a
handful of the highly effective 17-pdr guns towards the end of the North
African campaign, initially mounted on improvised 25-pdr carriages, that were
rushed into service in RA anti-tank regiments to counter the new generation
of heavily armoured Mk VI Tiger I tanks. This large, heavy and powerful towed
weapon ~ 76.2mm in calibre and mounted on a split trail carriage with gun
shield weighing in at three tons ~ first saw action in February 1943 and proved
capable of defeating all German tanks to date in service and was superior in
performance to the legendary German 88mm gun.

The mainstay of British Commonwealth field artillery regiments
throughout the Desert War was the redoubtable 25-pdr gun/howitzer,
introduced in 1937 into British service. The early 25-pdr used in North Africa
was a re-tubed 18-pdr on an improved carriage with a range of 11,800 yards.
The 25-pdr Mk II, introduced into service in late 1941, was far superior to the
earlier model and could throw a 25 Ib. shell a distance of 13,400 yards. Blast
effect was limited by the small amount of explosive in each shell (only 7 per
cent), however, which limited the destructiveness of the weapon against
fixed defences. A simple light turntable or platform made it an effective light
howitzer and it proved highly effective in killing troops caught in the open
and neutralizing those behind cover. The 25-pdr, employed in a direct-fire
role, came to be relied upon as the principal and most effective AT weapon
given the shortcomings of the 2-pdr. In this role it had a mixed record, since
its solid AP round was only effective under 1,200 yards. It diverted 25-pdrs
away from their true role, moreover, and in particular the suppression of
German anti-tank guns and batteries.

The 25-pdr shouldered much of the burden of providing indirect fire
support in the Western Desert, with the availability of modern medium and
heavy guns (firing a heavier shell at longer ranges) very much limited by the

pre-war army’s determination to restore mobility to the battlefield. Until newly

was mounted on an ingenious

travelling wheels to be lifted clear

modern, carefully designed 4.Sin. guns were not issued until 1941, with the
first 5.Sin, howitzers later in May 1942. These were major improvements and
highly effective in a counter-battery role at long range. The modern 4.Sin. guns
were capable of firing a 55 Ib. shell up to 20,500 yards, and the general-purpose
5.5in, howitzers were capable of firing a 100 Ib. shell up to 16,000 yards and
a 80 Ib. shell 18,600 yards. It was only when such modern weapons were
available in sufficient quantities that it was possible for gunners to use massed
concentrations of fire (refuting criticism of Eighth Army's inability to use
massed firepower beforehand).

Command, control,

communications, and intelligence

Command and control

The senior British officers who led Eighth Army arguably faced the greatest
challenge of their professional careers. To nearly all, armoured warfare was
virtually a new form of combat, and living, moving and fighting in the
desert was in itself a strange, demanding and novel experience. At the start
of Operation Crusader, for example, the army commander and both his corps
commanders had no experience of desert fighting or armoured warfare. They
faced perhaps the greatest German commander of World War II leading the
highly professional DAK. Their work was closely overseen throughout the
fighting by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, who in turn had Prime
Minister Winston Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff breathing down his neck.
The leaders of Eighth Army in North Africa also contended with a range of
fundamental difficulties affecting this formation. Eighth Army was the product
of the massive expansion of the British Commonwealth armies from a small
cadre into a new large wartime army with a resultant plummet in combat
effectiveness that took considerable time to remedy. They also had to contend
with chronic shortages of arms, equipment and ammunition resulting from
pre-war decisions and the priority accorded to rebuilding the Home Army
following Dunkirk. Commanding the polyglot Eighth Army, moreover, made up
of heterogenous forces drawn from many different countries and nationalities,
posed serious difficulties. Great care had to be taken, for example, in exercising
authority over troops drawn from the new dominions - Australia and New
Zealand — whose able and successful commanders unhesitatingly looked to
their own national leaders when they disagreed with command decisions. To
complicate matters in this respect relations were also embittered and distrustful
by the fact that commanders and staffs at all levels above division were British,
as were all tank units and units of the armoured divisions, except two South
African armoured car regiments. Given these myriad difficulties it should come
as no surprise that not all were up to the challenge. Indeed, North Africa proved
a graveyard for many reputations of commanders at all levels.

The Eighth Army suffered markedly in terms of continuity of command and
control, as well as of gaining institutional experience, during the Desert War.
\ combination of sackings, casualties during combat, capture, and transfer
elsewhere meant there was often a rapid changeover of senior commanders.
Indeed, between 1940 and 1943 Western Desert Force and its successor Eighth
Army had no less than six different commanders - Wavell, Richard O'Conner,
Cunningham, Neil Ritchie, Claude Auchinleck, and finally Bernard
Montgomery - in 16 months and during the period 1941-42 no less than
20 different divisions or equivalents went into battle under its command.
Only four - 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions, 4th Indian Division and 1st South
African Division — fought in more than two battles. In comparison, Rommel
commanded an army throughout the Desert War whose constituent German
formations remained pretty much unchanged. According to David Belchem
the result of such changeovers was that the British ‘seemed incapable of
profiting by our experience. No one seemed able to analyse our weaknesses,
and those of the enemy; there was no development of a dynamic tactical
policy.’ On occasion, dismissals were undoubtedly necessary - Cunningham

and Ritchie in particular - especially of men simply not up to the job or else
who had lost the confidence of their superiors. Other senior commanders
resigned when they believed their advice was being ignored. Cumulatively
these changes had an unsettling effect on subordinate commanders and the
army as a whole.

The unique conditions of desert warfare demanded initiative, flexibility
and independence of mind from leaders of small formations upwards. The
British Army clung, however, to a very rigid hierarchical top-down system of
command in North Africa, although lip service was paid to the devolution of
authority. Senior officers believed bringing order to the chaos of the modern
battlefield was only possible by practising an autocratic and highly centralized
command and control system. Discipline and instant obedience to orders was
the key. This belief permeated the entire fabric of the army from the top
down to the lowest level and was a product of the regimental system, training
and the general system. The resulting rigidity meant the initiative of junior
commanders was stifled and latitude denied them. Although this command
and control system worked very well at the outset of the Desert War against the
slow and pedantic Italians, against the Germans it was another matter. Indeed,
Eighth Army's cumbersome command and control system proved incapable
of reacting as quickly to rapidly changing situations as could the German. Col.
Fritz Bayerlein, the DAK’s Chief of Staff, noted following Operation Crusader
Eighth Army’s ‘unwieldy and rigidly methodical technique of command, their
over-systematic issuing of orders down to the last detail, leaving little latitude
to the junior commander.’ The practice of issuing often cumbersome and very
detailed written orders, instead of by word of mouth, exacerbated the situation
and in many respects played into Axis hands by limiting subordinate HQs
freedom of action on the battlefield. At the outset of the Desert War the
British Army also lacked tactical battle drills used so effectively by the Germans
that enabled them to work as a coordinated whole. Writing in February 1942
Auchinleck insisted: ‘The old system of issuing orders and of control in general
is not suitable for the swift moving warfare on very wide fronts which is likely
to obtain in this theatre.’

The style of leadership practised in Eighth Army left much to be desired.
During the early stages of the Desert War the majority of British field
commanders in Eighth Army did not lead from the front, preferring instead
to exercise command ftom far behind the lines in accordance with FSR,
largely due to the limitations of signals technology and shortages of suitable
equipment. Indeed, following O’Conner's capture in April 1941 GHQ Middle
East enjoined senior commanders and staff officers to exercise considerable
care so that they did not become unnecessary casualties. During Operation
Crusader and the Gazala battles the location of Eighth Army’s HQ was largely
dictated by requirements of supporting the Desert Air Force and of maintaining
good communications back to Cairo. In the end it proved too far back and
both Cunningham and Ritchie lost touch with Corps HQ and the battlefield.
Similarly the majority of subordinate commanders followed a remote approach
to command and control, with many reluctant to delegate command or go
forward themselves to monitor a developing battle. A few honourable
exceptions existed. During Operation Crusader Lt. Gen. Willoughby-Norrie,
GOC XXX Corps, led from a small tactical HQ of four vehicles carrying staff
officers, a wireless on the corps forward net and another tuned to intercept
messages from Rommel’s armoured divisions. Similarly Maj. Gen. W.H. Gott,
GOC 7th Armoured Division, led from a tank up to 20 miles in advance of
his Advanced HQ. Attempts made to emulate the Germans and lead from the
front had serious drawbacks given communication problems. A small and
ill-protected party constantly on the move had great difficulty in keeping
touch, moreover, with the changing situation and maintaining effective
communications with its own HQs and supporting arms and services - but if

======================================================================

======================================================================

they remained in the rear in contact with GHQ at Cairo or air support they
risked losing contact with forward units. A major problem, however, was the
ncreased risk of death, injury or capture. During Rommel’s dash to the wire
Cunningham came very close to falling into enemy hands and only escaped by
air with minutes in hand. In May 1942, for example, Maj. Gen. Frank Messervy,
GOC 7th Armoured Division, was captured when his forward HQ was overrun
py the DAK. Fortunately in this instance he concealed his rank and escaped
back to British lines. The vital necessity of senior commanders leading from the
front and maintaining close control over fast-moving armoured battles was
clearly recognized by mid 1942. A Court of Enquiry convened to investigate the
reasons for the collapse of the Gazala Line and the fall of Tobruk in June 1942
concluded unequivocally that commanders had to lead from the front. By the
time of Alamein the HQ at Eighth Army had at last signals communications
sufficient to command near the forward edge of the battle area, enabling them
to receive information and issue orders in a timely fashion. The British did not
have good command tanks and radios, however, until very late in the day. By
Alamein it had at last become common practice for formation commanders in
Eighth Army to exercise command in battle from a small Tactical HQ

The ability of the British command and control structure in North Africa
to function effectively and impose a firm, effective directing intelligence and
will, was badly hampered by poor relations between commanders and a far
too democratic approach to command. While the command structure worked
relatively smoothly during Operation Crusader, the seeds of future difficulties
permeating from the top down through the chain of command had been sown
in terms of the relationship between the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East and
the GOC Eighth Army. The first commander of Eighth Army appointed by Gen.
Sir Claude Auchinleck - Cunningham - proved not up to the task despite his
success in East Africa and was dismissed after losing the
confidence of his superior. The appointment of Maj.
Gen. Neil Ritchie (his DCGS at GHQ Middle East) as his
replacement proved controversial and perhaps badly
mistaken. Although conversant with the plans for
the operation and the Commander-in-Chief’s ideas, he
lacked operational experience of commanding large
formations under desert conditions and was junior
to his corps commanders. In large part due to this
inexperience during Operation Crusader Auchinleck
flew to Ritchie’s HQ on 1 December and stayed for
10 days, starting a practice of giving his subordinate
advice’ which undermined his authority in the eyes
of his subordinates. It was an impossible position and
meant Ritchie never exerted an effective grip on his
army. Mutual trust and confidence between British
senior officers broke down in the later stages of
Operation Crusader. Both Maj. Gen. Leslie Morshead
and Maj. Gen. Bernard Freyburg, for example, lost
confidence in British leadership and especially the
ability of the armoured units, A growing atmosphere
of lack of confidence, mistrust and recrimination was
exacerbated when Godwin-Austin, GOC XXX Corps,
at his own request was relieved of command over
a difference of opinion with Ritchie, despite many
believing he was in the right. His replacement, Gott,
was a close friend of Norrie and the two of them
clubbed together against the GOC Eighth Army
practising ‘a sort of joint command by confabulation,
at one stage co-locating their headquarters.’ On several

occasions it appeared both Corps commanders ganged up on Ritchie since they
believed he was little more than Auchinleck’s mouthpiece. This effectively
undermined the GOC Eighth Army, who hesitated to shake off his previous
appointment as a senior staff officer at Middle East Command, assert his own
authority by insisting he should be given freedom to command his army in
his own way or be replaced or curb the flow of advice from above. As a result
the Gazala Battles were fought in an unhappy atmosphere of distrust and
recrimination, which meant teamwork within Eighth Army suffered badly. At
a higher command level Gazala was characterized by the failure to impose,
from top down, a directing intelligence and will. Ritchie was all too fond of
holding long, lengthy and inconclusive conferences rather than issuing direct
commands. A fatal ambiguity and lack of authority spread downwards through
the chain of command. Orders were received, doubted, questioned, discussed
and time and initiative was thereby lost.

The fall of Tobruk and the rapidly deteriorating position thereafter as the
DAK raced into Egypt meant that on 25 June Auchinleck relieved Ritchie, whom
he correctly felt was too slow and had lost the confidence of his troops, and
took over command of Eighth Army himself. While still remaining the titular
Commander-in-Chief he left Lt. Gen. Corbett, his CGS, to act as his deputy
on all matters in Cairo, except those of the highest political and strategic
importance. The assumption of command by Auchinleck of both Eighth Army
and Commander-in-Chief Middle East proved effective in bringing Rommel to
a halt, but was proved an awkward system of command in practice. Auchinleck
realized the importance of actually commanding his subordinates, rather than
constant discussion and making reference to subordinates. The burden of
command was simply too great, however, for one man.

The appointment of Lt. Gen, Bernard Law
Montgomery as GOC Eighth Army and Gen. Sir
Harold Alexander as Commander-in-Chief, Middle
East in August 1942 ushered in a whole new phase
of the Desert War and a period of far more effective
command and professional control of Eighth Army. A
close working relationship was enjoyed by these old
friends and colleagues, who perhaps most importantly
understood and had complete confidence in each
other. It meant Montgomery was largely left alone
to exercise command of Eighth Army. This highly
professional and experienced officer introduced a new
style of leadership that dominated this formation
until the end of the Desert War. As GOC Eighth Army
Montgomery quickly proved himself a highly able
commander who radiated confidence, inspiration and
calmness to his shaken and confused command,
and brought with him a whole new authoritarian
approach to command. Unlike his predecessors he
proved steel-willed and brooked no criticism or
discussion from his fractious subordinates, Indeed,
Montgomery was well aware of the prevalent habit of
disregarding and questioning, or delay in complying
with unpalatable orders, and he was determined it
would be stamped out. Those not up to the mark were
quickly replaced by new men amenable to his will,
whom he knew, trusted and were judged capable of
performing the jobs allocated to them. No undue
criticism or deliberate procrastination was brooked
Indeed, Montgomery was well aware of the previous
tendency displayed by senior commands to discuss

======================================================================
PAGE 59
======================================================================

and debate orders and issued an order forbidding ‘bellyaching’. Orders were
orders and not to be discussed. To drive home his point in due course he sacked

Gen. Herbert Lumsden from X Corps for failing to fully carry out the GOC

ghth Army's instructions. He quickly realized the importance of inspiring
confidence amongst his troops, showmanship, and making them feel he held
a winning hand and that his methods would secure final victory

The new GOC Eighth Army broke with standard British practice at Eighth
Army's HQ by appointing a Chief of Staff responsible for coordinating the
whole work of this headquarters, although the Army Commander remained
available for consultation by senior officers. The appointment of Brig. Freddie
ce Guingand proved an excellent choice, effectively freeing the Army
Commander to tour his units and devote considerable time and energy to
improving fighting spirit throughout Eighth Army. His HQ was quickly co-
located with the Desert Air Force at Burg el Arab to improve communications
and liaison, which began the formation of a close inter-service team that
eventually oversaw the development of army-air doctrine in North Africa.
A section of personal liaison officers was also formed at Eighth Army's
HQ, tasked with touring frontline formations and monitoring progress, as a
supplement to radio reports, and reporting whether orders had actually been
fully carried out.

Overall, Montgomery's method of command proved ideally suited to fighting
deliberate battles in which the British enjoyed considerable material superiority,
very unlike those mobile engagements that had bewildered and confused his
predecessors. His command style quickly inspired confidence under the men he
led, whose belief in him was cemented by victory at Alam el Halfa.

Communications in the Desert War

he exercise of effective command and control in the Western Desert by
successive commanders at all levels, during the confusion and chaos associated
with fast-moving armoured warfare, always depended in large part on good
communications to transmit orders and pass on accurate, timely and vital
information, thus allowing informed choices to be made about rapidly
changing battlefield situations. The Eighth Army suffered from serious defects
in communications technology during the Desert War largely beyond the

control of its commanders, which was all the more problematic given the sheer
scale of the theatre of war, the wide dispersal of combat units and the high
tempo of operations.

‘The use of traditional and most secure methods of transmitting information
= telephone, morse key and teleprinter - functioned effectively above army
level in North Africa. The fast moving nature of desert warfare, however,
largely limited the use of cable, the most reliable, secure and quickest form of
communications, for transmitting information below this level of the chain
of command. It was simply too slow to lay cable as HQs shifted rapidly from
location to location and it was extremely vulnerable to shellfire or the passage
of tracked vehicles. Only during periods of static operations did it come into
its own, such as during the siege of Tobruk or at El Alamein. Visual signalling
methods were often of limited utility in the clouds of dust and sand that
cloaked the battlefield.

The Eighth Army was forced to rely on radiotelephony (RT) to an extent
never before appreciated by the pre-war British Army, which had not fully
developed or explored the full potential of this mode of communication.
Indeed, only the Royal Tank Corps had paid much attention to radios and
forced the Royal Signals to develop sets for vehicles, Most infantry units knew
little about the use of RT at the start of World War Il. During the first years
of the Desert War it proved a slow, erratic and often unreliable means of
communication with its short range in the wide expanses of the desert liable to
interruption at crucial points. The virtual collapse of Eighth Army's command
network in the first week of Operation Crusader largely accounts for the
commitment of armoured brigades in dribs and drabs rather than as a
coordinated whole. Even small breakdowns in technology or systems could
wreak havoc given the poor state of radio communications. On 22 November
1941 when 4th Armoured Brigade lost four radio sets, for example, command
and control virtually collapsed for the remainder of the day. As a result
commanders were frequently out of touch with their own units and the
situation. Situation reports were often long outdated when they reached
Army and Corps commanders, effectively limiting their ability to coordinate
subordinate formations, even when signals were operating at peak
