BATTLEGROUP •  RULES O PEN  F IRE! T   here are many different types of  weapons and many different types  of target, and this chapter deals with  them all, from an infantryman armed  with a rifle or submachine gun, up to  the largest calibre howitzers, multiple  rocket launchers, flamethrowers, anti- aircraft cannons and everything else.  These weapons also have various effects,  depending upon the target. Firing is  dealt with in two different ways, with  different effects. The first is Area Fire  and the second is Aimed Fire. Area Fire  is less accurate and less likely to cause  death and destruction, but is more likely  to pin a target. Aimed Fire is shooting at  a visible and identified enemy to destroy  it. Do not fall into the trap of believing  that Aimed Fire is somehow ‘better’ than  Area Fire, both have an important place,  and pinning an enemy is a very useful  tactic, because an unpinned enemy is  able to move and fire back, whilst a  pinned one can be manoeuvred against  to get into a good position to destroy  them. You will need to use both to  achieve victory... FIRING BASICS There are two rules that all units firing  at the enemy, by whatever method, must  comply with. The first is line of sight, the  second is range. A target unit must be  within the firing unit’s line of sight and  range before it can be engaged with any  type of fire. FIRE ARCS All units have an arc of fire, depending  upon what type of the unit they are. Infantry All infantry squads and teams have a  360° arc of fire. They are nimble and fast  enough to be able bring their weapons to  bear quickly in any direction. Deployed Guns A deployed gun or mortar has a 90°arc  of fire to the front. If a target unit is not  within this forward arc then it cannot  be targeted. Vehicles Vehicles with fixed weapons (not in  turrets or pintle-mounted) have a 45°  arc of fire to the front. If a target unit is  not within this limited arc of fire, then it  cannot be targeted. T34/43 20

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Turrets If a vehicle’s weapon is mounted in (or  on) a turret, it has a 360°arc of fire.  Pintle-Mounts A vehicle with a pintle-mounted  weapon, such as a machine gun, has a  360°arc of fire. If the pintle-mount is on  top of the turret, then this is independent  of the direction the turret is facing. BASIC RANGES All weapons have a maximum range,  summarized here. If a target unit is  beyond this maximum range then it is  automatically missed.

The men or crew might be  hiding in a ditch nearby, manoeuvring to find  better concealment or just hugging any cover, but  they can’t do much else. A unit can only have one  pinned marker at a time. Additional pinned results  have no further effect. A pinned unit cannot be  given any orders, and will thus do nothing until its  pinning marker is removed.  Panzer IVH OPEN FIRE! If a unit’s order allows it to open fire,  then the commanding player can choose  which type of fire he will use, what type  of ammunition he will use (if he has a  choice, such as armour-piercing shells  or high-explosive shells) and he must  nominate an enemy unit as his target.  He must state these before he begins to  resolve the firing or rolls any dice, and  they cannot be changed once any dice  have been rolled. Example of Firing Basics  A T-34 has been given the Fire and  Manoeuvre order. Before firing, it must  choose a type of fire; in this case it will be  Aimed Fire. It must select which weapon  or ammunition to use. As a tank, it has  machine guns and its main gun. It will  use its main gun, which can fire either  high-explosive or armour piercing shells.  Its target (in line of sight and range) is  an enemy anti-tank gun, so it selects a  high-explosive shell. This will be resolved as  aimed fire with high-explosive shells. 21

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A REA  F IRE WITH SMALL ARMS, MACHINE GUNS & HIGH-EXPLOSIVE SHELLS A rea fire is used to harass the     enemy, keep their heads down  and generally scare the willies out of  them! Its primary intention is not to kill  the enemy, although casualties might be  caused as a desirable side effect of the  hot lead flying about. Its primary role is  to pin the enemy, and generally make it  difficult or impossible for them to move  or fight back. Keeping the enemy under  a hail of bullets and shells will go a long  way to achieving victory, because most  soldiers would rather take cover and  stay there when the bullets are coming  thick and fast, rather than get up and  fight back. This is the main effect of area  fire – making it hard for the enemy to  fight back. USING AREA FIRE When a unit opens fire, it can choose to  use Area Fire, spraying the area with  bullets and shells. Follow the steps  below. 1. Roll for Area Fire Effect.      See the Area Fire Effect Table. 2. Roll the target unit’s Cover Save. 1. AREA FIRE EFFECT TABLE Cross Reference the firing unit’s Rate of  Fire, or the type and size of shell being  used, and the range to the target, with  the target unit type. This will give the  die roll required to pin the target unit. If  the test is passed, the unit must make a  cover save. If it fails, then the firing was  too wild and has no effect. A ‘-’ mark  means that there is no chance of causing  pinning against that target with this  weapon. 2. COVER SAVE Under fire, men seek cover; it is a natural  response, and the better the cover, the  better the chance of survival. Of course,  this also applies to gun crews and  vehicle crews. A vehicle, well concealed  or dug-in to cover is also better  protected than one in the open, but it  is far harder to hide a tank than a man.  This is represented by a Cover Save.  Open As it says, the unit is not in any cover  represented on the table. Players should  remember that even in the open, infantry  will find some form of cover. Bushes  and long grass provide cover, as well as  dips in the ground not represented upon  a flat wargaming table. Soldiers under  fire can always lie low for cover, and we  assume that they do, even though our  static model soldiers cannot. MG42 heavy    machine gun team 1.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Soft Cover The unit has some form of cover that  makes it harder to see them, even if it  wouldn’t be very effective at stopping  a bullet or shrapnel. This might include  woods, bushes or an overgrown thicket,  crop fields (when ripe), or a wooden  fence.  Hard Cover The unit has good cover that makes it  harder to see them and would stop a  bullet. This could be inside a building, or  behind stone wall. Dug-in vehicles also  count as in hard cover against area fire.  Reinforced Cover This is improved hard cover, designed  to withstand fire, such as in trenches  and foxholes. It could also represent  a fortified position, such as buildings  reinforced as defensive positions. This  also includes bunkers and strongpoints  constructed of wood. Hardened Cover This is the toughest cover, designed  to withstand the heaviest fire, such as  concrete bunkers or reinforced pillboxes.  Units inside will be very difficult to pin. PINNING If the target unit fails to pass its Cover  Save, then it is marked as pinned. A  pinned unit cannot be given any orders  until its pinning marker is removed.  AREA FIRE AND CASUALTIES Of course, with shells landing and  bullets fizzing past, there is a chance that  there will be casualties. If an infantry  unit or a deployed gun rolls a 1 for  its cover save, then as well as being  pinned, the unit also takes one casualty,  wounded or killed by the fire. No morale  test is required for this loss. Vehicles are  not affected, they just become pinned.  Example of Area Fire A German heavy MG42 team is given the  Open Fire! order, and chooses to target Area  Fire at a Russian infantry unit, 18” away,  and a supporting SU-76, 27" away. The  heavy machine guns RoF is 8, so at 18" it  needs a 4+ to pin the infantry, and a 6+ for  the open-topped armoured vehicle.  The HMG team roll a 5 and a 6, passing  both. The infantry are in the open, so need a  6 cover save. They roll a 1 and fail, and are  marked as pinned. They also take a single  casualty because of the roll of a 1. The SU-76  is obscured in a treeline, it needs a 6, and  rolls a 4, failing. It too is now marked as  pinned. Above: Infantry of the Regina Rifles  occupy cover in a damaged store front.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A IMED  F IRE WITH SMALL ARMS & MACHINE GUNS A imed Fire is observing the target  and trying to hit and destroy it.  This is far harder to do than Area Fire,  which just requires the bullets and shells  to land in vaguely the correct area.  Aimed Fire requires proper sighting and  judgement to actually hit the target(s),  not always easy in the heat of battle.  Aimed Fire is a little more involved than  Area Fire and requires the commander  to complete the following steps: 1.  Observe the target 2.  Roll to Hit the target 3.  Target’s Cover Save 4.  Target’s Morale test 1.OBSERVATION Before a unit can fire at an enemy target,  it must know that it is there. This is  called observation. As the battlegroup  commander, you are removed from the  front line, not actually lying in the dirt  with the enemy ahead of you. Much  as you might wish your units to act  according to orders, they just won’t  always be able to. Observation covers all  of the possible reasons a unit might fail  to see and engage a target. To start with,  this is a battlefield; there is a lot of dust  and smoke, which isn’t easily shown  with models on a wargaming tabletop.  The dust and smoke make seeing the  enemy hard and it could momentarily  obscure a target.  In battle it is surprising how little of  the enemy soldiers can see. They rarely  get a clear view of them (if they did,  then the enemy would be dead), and  often fight entire battles without ever  seeing anything of the enemy, except  perhaps muzzle flashes, or the dead or  a few wounded prisoners afterwards.  Just because you, as the player, have  a God-like overview of the miniature  battlefield, those men (models) on the  ground do not. They are mostly crawling  around, keeping their heads down and  trying not to get hit.  The first step of any Aimed Fire is  observing the enemy. It is easier to spot  an enemy unit that has been firing than  one that hasn’t, because of the muzzle  flashes and smoke. Look up the relevant  target unit, apply any modifiers, and  roll a D6 to observe it. If the target is  ‘automatic’ do not roll, it is always  observed, regardless of any modifiers.  If the roll fails then no further action is  taken. Obscured simply means the unit  has any form of cover at all.  See the  Observation Table below. 2. TO HIT With the enemy observed, the next task  is to hit them. With small arms fire and  machine guns (up to and including  larger autocannons), this is done by  using the firing unit’s Rate of Fire (RoF).  Total up the unit’s RoF, and this is the  number of D6 that must be rolled to hit.  Also listed on the Small Arms table is  each weapon’s maximum range, beyond  which their RoF counts as 0, and the  minimum crew requirements to fire the  weapon. A weapon without the required  crew can still fire, but counts as half its  normal RoF (round fractions down).  Extra crew members do not add their  RoF to crew-served weapons, they have  other jobs and act as a reserve crew. The  Special column lists any other rules or  features.   AIMED FIRE ‘TO HIT’ TABLE Once the total RoF has been established,  take that number of D6 and roll to hit,  cross referencing against the range to the  target on the Aimed Fire ‘to hit’ table. 1. observation table Infantry in the Open Firing   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Infantry in the Open     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Obscured Infantry Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Obscured Infantry  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 4+ Deployed Gun in the Open Firing    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Deployed Gun in the Open   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Gun Firing    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Gun    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Vehicle in the Open Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Vehicle in the Open  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Vehicle Firing  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 2+ Obscured Vehicle  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 3+ Aircraft    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . automatic Modifiers If the observing unit has the Scout special rule   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . +1 If the target unit is an Infantry team of three men of less  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . -1 2.  s M all   ar M s   rate   o F F ire Weapon    RoF   Maximum Range   Crew   Special Rifle	 1	 30 "   - SMG	 1(2)*	 10 "   - Light 	 MG	 2	 30 "   1 man Medium 	 MG	 5	 30 "   2 men Heavy 	 MG	 6	 40 "   3 men MG34 	 – 	 bipod 	 mount	 5	 30 "   2 men MG 	 42 	 – 	 bipod 	 mount	 6	 30 "   2 men MG34 	 – 	 tripod 	 mount	 7	 40 "   2 men MG42 	 – 	 tripod 	 mount	 8	 40 "   2 men Tank MG  (bow, co-axial, etc) 	 3	 30 " Pintle 	 mount 	 MG	 5	 40 "   Light Autocannon  (20mm) 	 6	 50 "   2 men   also Light HE Heavy Autocannon  (37mm and 40mm) 	 8	 50 "   3 men   also Light HE Multiple 	 Autocannons	 10	 50 "   2 men   also 2 x Light HE Multiple 	 Medium 	 MG 	 mount	 10	 30 "   3 men   Man-pack 	 Flamethrower	 10	 5 "   1 man   one shot only  .

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES 3. COVER SAVE For each hit rolled the target unit must  take a Cover Save. The Cover Save is  exactly the same as for Area Fire, but  is repeated here for clarity. Note that  against aimed fire, make one save  against each hit, not just one save for  the unit. For each save failed, remove a  model as a casualty. 4. MORALE TEST The target unit might then be requested  to take a Morale test. See the Unit  Morale section for full details of this.  Suffice to say here, any casualties will  usually cause a Morale test to be taken. Damage to Infantry For each Cover Save failed, the target  unit must remove a model as a casualty.  If a unit is destroyed then take a battle  counter for its loss. Damage to Deployed Guns If a deployed gun is reduced to having  no crew remaining, then it counts as  destroyed. If a unit is destroyed, then  take a battle counter for its loss. Damage to Soft-skinned vehicles Soft-skinned vehicles are not designed  to take fire, and can quite easily be  destroyed. All soft-skinned vehicles have  a number of hits listed in the vehicle  data. Once they have taken this number  of hits, they are destroyed; until then,  they act as normal.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Example of Aimed Fire at Infantry A Russian Maxim machine gun team is  given the Open Fire! order, and chooses to  target a German Infantry squad 12 "  away,  and a German MG34 machine gun team  23 "  away. The infantry squad are in the  cover of a wheat field, but the MG team are  in the open. First, the Maxim rolls to observe the  infantry squad, which hasn’t fired, so the roll  needed is a 3+. A 6 is rolled so the Maxim  team has spotted them. The Maxim has a  RoF of 5, so five dice are rolled. At 12 "  they  need 4+ to hit. Three hits are scored. The  Germans are in a the wheat field, so require a  soft cover save of 5+. They save two, and one  man is hit and down. The German infantry  squad can’t use the Fall back! rule, because  they haven’t taken enough damage and are  in cover. They must now take a Morale test  because they lost a man. Next target. The MG34 team has been firing,  so will be spotted on a 2+. A 4 is rolled, and  it has been identified. The Maxim opens up  again, rolling five dice, needing 5+ to hit at  23 " . It scores two hits. The Germans take  their ‘in the open’ cover saves of 6+, but fail  both. Eek, two men from the three man team  are down. Instead of taking the casualties  the German player chooses to Fall back!  The Russian player moves them back to the  nearest cover (a wood line 7 "  away). One  man is lost in the retreat, and the unit is  marked as pinned. Any units inside a destroyed transport  vehicle (armoured or soft-skinned) take  D3 casualties, with no Cover save, are  immediately placed within 4" of the  wreck and marked as pinned. They must  then take a unit Morale test for the losses  (and trauma).  Damage to Transported Troops Troops being transported inside any soft- skinned vehicle can also be lost to enemy  fire. Any additional hits on the vehicle  count against the transported men  inside. So, if a medium truck can take  three hits and actually takes four, then  the extra hit counts against the troops  inside. A passenger squad may make a  soft cover save (5+) against the hits.  I nfantry caught in a hail of fire can opt  to avoid heavy casualties by using the  Fall back! special rule.  If any infantry unit is in the open and  takes two or more casualties from an   enemy unit’s fire, then they can choose  to Fall Back! This means they will only  take a single casualty but, instead of the  other losses, their opponent can move  the unit backwards (away from the  source of fire or from the closest enemy  unit) up to 10", or into any cover within  that 10", whichever is less (any cover  must be used if available). The unit is  marked as pinned after the move. The  casualty does not cause the unit to take a  morale test, they fell back instead.  Note, that an infantry unit cannot  choose to Fall Back! if it comes under fire  from which it takes no, or only a single  casualty, is pinned, or if it already has  some cover. The situation isn’t serious  enough to cause the infantry to seek  better cover or get out of the line of fire,  and they won’t give up any cover they  have whilst under fire.  Only infantry units (squads or teams) can  Fall Back! Vehicles cannot and neither  can the crew of a deployed gun or mortar  (because that’s called abandoning the  gun and is dealt with by unit morale).  Units which Fall Back! off the table count  as routed (ie. destroyed).  Gaz AAA truck with  motorised infantry Example of Fall back! A German infantry squad is attacking a  building occupied by a Russian squad.  Using the Infantry Assault order, the  Germans cross a low wall and move into  Close Assault range, but the Russians are  waiting and use Ambush Fire, scoring three  casualties. Rather than take the casualties  and the resulting morale test the Germans  choose to Fall back! The Russian player  moves them back to the low wall, as this  is the closest cover away from the fire and  less than 10" away (if there was no wall,  he could have just moved them back the  full 10"). The Germans remove just one  casualty, seek the protection of the wall, and  are marked as pinned. FALL BACK! Example of Aimed Fire at a Vehicle A German MG34 team is given the Fire and  Move order. First they will Open Fire! at a  Russian troop truck, just 9" away, then the  team will move back.  First they must Observe the truck. The truck  is a vehicle in the open, which didn’t fire (it  has no guns). They require a 2+, the roll is  a 5 and they pass. The crew cut loose. The  bipod mounted MG34 has a firepower of  five and needs 3+ to hit. Five hits are rolled  – ouch! As a vehicle in the open, the truck  has no Cover save, so takes three hits and is  destroyed. The extra two hits are passed on  to the passenger squad, which must make a  5+ cover save against them. One is saved,  and one man is removed. The squad is placed  within 4" of its wrecked truck and marked as  pinned. Because of the casualty, the infantry  must now take a morale test as well.  26

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES INFANTRY CLOSE ASSAULT ‘Grenade!’ All infantry squads and weapon teams  are assumed to have grenades. The  attacking unit can add an extra D6 to  its total RoF, as men begin to post and  throw grenades into enemy positions.  Infantry vs Infantry    at Close Assault Range This is likely to be deadly for both  sides. An infantry unit engaging the  enemy at 5" range or less adds up its  total RoF value as normal, including the  extra D6 for thrown grenades and bold  individuals charging in, bayonet fixed or  entrenching tool in hand. Observation  is automatic in close assaults. Such  boldness is also potentially lethal to the  attacker, and the enemy will fight back.   Simultaneous with resolving the  assaulting unit’s fire, an unpinned  enemy unit can fire back. Resolve  this as normal, without any order  required. Note, the defenders get  their bonus for having SMGs, and  but do not get a ‘Grenade!’ bonus.  Both sides make Cover saves against  any hits as normal. If both sides are  inside the same building, they both  count as in hard cover. Units may not  Fallback! from a close assault. T   here is an order that allows  infantry units to Close Assault  the enemy, using bayonets, sub- machine guns, grenades and so on, to  maximum effect. When an infantry  unit uses the Infantry Close Assault  order to get to within 5" of an enemy  unit a few special rules are used,  detailed below. Close Assault is also  used for attacking enemy vehicles  with anti-tank grenades and other  improvised anti-tank weapons (see  anti-tank grenades on page 34). Sub-Machine Guns At their most effective in close  assaults, a sub-machine gun has its  firepower increased to 2 when used at  under 5" for an Infantry Close Assault.  Above: SU-76s provide support for an  infantry assault. (Novosti 851285) 27

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES I NFANTRY  W EAPONS  OF  W ORLD  W AR II Rifles Enfield MkIV, M1 Garand, Mosin- Nagant and Mauser Kar 98K were  the standard service rifles of the main  combatants. They are all rifles, and as  such have a RoF of 1, and a maximum  range of 30". All infantry are assumed to  have a rifle, even if gun crew or a rear  echelon supply unit.  Sub-Machine Guns General service sub-machine guns  were the US Thompson, British Sten,  Russian PPsH, and the German standard  service weapons were the MP38 and  MP40. Only really useful in close  contact with the enemy, SMGs really  come into their own in Close Assaults.  A single infantryman per squad, with  the appropriately armed model, can  be equipped with an SMG. They have  a RoF of 1 up to their maximum range  of just 10". In an assault they count as  having a RoF of 2.  Light Machine Gun Common, light squad support weapons  were the British Bren, US BAR and  Russian DP, known as the ‘record  player’ due to its distinctive circular pan  magazine. All light machine guns have a  RoF of 2 and a maximum range of 30".  Medium Machine Gun The US M1919 .30 calibre MG, British  Vickers and the Russian Maxim have a  RoF of 5, with a maximum range of 30"  or 40". It requires at least two men to  fire the weapon. If a single man is left  manning it, then its firepower is halved  (rounded down) to just 2. Heavy Machine Gun The US M2 .50 calibre HMG and the Red  Army’s DshK, were most often used as  a heavy anti-aircraft machine guns. So  good were they that they both remain  in service to this day. A HMG has a RoF  of 6, and a maximum range of 40". It  requires three men to fire the weapon. If  fewer crew are left manning it, then its  firepower is halved to 3. MG-34 The standard light machine gun of the  German Army from the start of the war,  it was usually fired from a bipod, as a  squad support weapon. In this case it  has a  RoF of 5 and a maximum range  of 30". It could also be mounted on a  tripod for sustained fire. In this case it  has a RoF of 7 and maximum range of  40". Regardless of its mount, the MG34  requires a crew of 2 to fire at full effect.  If reduced to a single man, then its RoF  is halved (rounded down) to 2 from a  bipod, and 3 from a tripod.  MG-42 A superb weapon with a ferocious rate  of fire, the MG-42 was a state of the  art weapon that only enter service in  1943. Fired from a bipod, it has a RoF  of 6 and maximum range of 30". When  mounted for sustained fire on a tripod,  it has a RoF of 8 and maximum range of  40”. Regardless of its mount, the MG42  requires a crew of two to fire at full  effect. If reduced to a single man, then its  RoF is halved (rounded down) to 3 from  a bipod, and 4 from a tripod. Autocannons Light cannons, usually with an  automated feed, were commonly fielded  as anti-aircraft weapons, but were  mounted on lighter vehicles as well.  They are versatile weapons and were  commonly used for ground fire.  20mm Light autocannons of roughly 20mm  calibre fire high-explosive tipped  rounds, as well as incendiary shells for  their extra damage against aircraft. They  have a RoF of 6 and have a maximum  range of 50". An autocannon can be used  for Area Fire, using either its RoF or its  very light HE rating, whichever is best.  It is treated as having a RoF 6 when  used for Aimed Fire. Against armoured  vehicles it can also be used for Aimed  Fire with armour piercing shells, in  which case treat it like any other armour  piercing shell. 37mm and 40mm Heavy autocannons of 37mm and 40mm  fire larger high-explosive and incendiary  shells, usually with a lower rate of fire,  but harder hitting impact. They have a  RoF of 8 and have a maximum range of  50". An autocannon can be used for Area  Fire, using either its RoF or its very light  HE rating, whichever is best. It is treated  as having RoF 8 when used for Aimed  Fire. Against armoured vehicles it can  also be used for Aimed Fire with armour  piercing shells, in which case treat it like  any other armour piercing shot. Flamethrowers As well as dealing with small arms RoF,  Aimed Fire also covers flamethrowers  – fearsome tools of war, lethal against  static targets like bunkers and buildings.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Flamethrowers are either man-pack, i.e.  carried by an infantryman, or vehicle  mounted. A man-pack flamethrower  has enough fuel for a single burst of  flame, so once it has been used it cannot  be used again. A vehicle mounted  flamethrower will have its ammunition  listed in its profile. Flamethrowers have a RoF of 10 and  can only be used against stationary  targets, be that a building or bunker  or a static vehicle. If the target moved  last turn then it cannot be targeted by  a flamethrower. This does not include  infantry inside buildings, which may  have moved into the building, but can  still be targeted because the building is  really the target. If used against a static  vehicle, they have a random penetration  value, determined by rolling a D6, and  always attack the vehicle’s side armour  value. A unit hit by a flamethrower also  counts as in the Open for Cover saves.  Flamethrowers are fearsome weapons,  hated by soldiers who, naturally, fear  their effects. The first time any enemy  unit is attacked by a flamethrower,  then its commander must take a battle  counter. This is because of the terror  such weapons instill in those at risk of  incineration. Light Mortars Light infantry support weapons of  approximately 50mm calibre (or 2"),  throwing small mortar bombs up to  approximately 500 metres. They have a  minimum range of 5" and a maximum  range of 20". They were generally being  removed from the orders of battle, but  many units retained them.
