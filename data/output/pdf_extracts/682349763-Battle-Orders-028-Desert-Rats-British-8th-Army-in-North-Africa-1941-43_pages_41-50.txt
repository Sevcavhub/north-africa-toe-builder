The Eighth Army still had a major training deficit when it was first formed
and was still largely unable to practise fast-moving armoured warfare and
combined-arms operations. Indeed, following the disappointing Operation
Battleaxe Auchinleck deliberately resisted pressure to commit Eighth Army
to battle before progress had been made in remedying this serious fault. As
one historian has observed: ‘Battleaxe was for the more experienced British
armoured units, and above all for higher commanders ... a grim lesson in how
expert one now needed to be to wage war, and how long a lead the enemy
seemed to have acquired. The British Army was still inadequately trained.’
Indeed, Eighth Army was still badly in need of an effective battlefield doctrine
for waging a fast-moving armoured warfare under the conditions imposed
by the Desert War. It also needed intensive, appropriate training given the
wide variation in training standards in living, moving and fighting under
desert conditions.

‘This training deficit affected all levels of Eighth Army - commanders and
staffs, formations and individually. The commanders and staff of Fighth Army,
for example, had only been together for eight weeks before being committed
to Operation Crusader, while XXX Corps had had only six weeks to work up.
Neither had trained together adequately before being committed to battle and
badly needed practice in the handling of units and formations together and in
co-operation with the three arms.

The standard of training and overall battle worthiness of formations serving
in Eighth Army varied widely. 7th Armoured Division and 4th Indian Division
still provided a highly experienced hardcore in November 1941. A combination
of battle casualties, sickness and cross-posting of officers, NCOs and men, as
the entire British Army underwent massive expansion, meant that while still
good neither of these formations was of the same high quality. The remainder
of Eighth Army was of widely differing combat effectiveness, however, with
many having much to learn. 22nd Armoured Brigade in October 1941 still
lacked training as a brigade in the totally unfamiliar conditions of the desert.
Ist South African Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. G.E. Brink, was thrown
into battle during Operation Crusader before it was really ready for action and
suffered accordingly. It was deemed insufficiently trained under desert
conditions, largely as it had not received all its motor transport. As Norrie
reported on 2 November: ‘The spirit of the division and the desire to fight
could not be better. However, unless more time for desert training is provided,
I cannot see how this division can be expected to succeed on the battlefield.’
Such problems were exacerbated by the frequent chopping and changing
of units and subordinate brigades between brigades, divisions and corps. It
meant few units or formations had had an opportunity to get to know or
operate alongside each other before battle began and prevented building up
institutional experience and amassing experience.

The British paid a heavy penalty for lack of training during Operation
Crusader, although the battle was ultimately a success. The Germans certainly
thought Eighth Army troops were good basic material. A German battalion IC
later wrote: ‘The English and Australians are tough and hard opponents as
individual fighters, highly skilled in defence, unimaginative and inflexible
in attack, cold-blooded and skilled in in-fighting, experienced in assault, and
capable of standing hardships of all kinds.’2° The Germans firmly believed,
however, that the overall poor combat performance of Commonwealth troops
was primarily due to lack of training. This was a powerful and accurate
critique. A serious effort was made to improve during the spring of 1942, but
was largely overtaken by events. The level of training in Eighth Army did not
undergo massive improvement for a considerable period of time. By the time

of Gazala, battle had taken its toll and the remainder had been replaced by a
large influx of inexperienced, ill-trained new blood, who were thrown into
battle before they were ready.

The lessons learnt during Operation Crusader about fighting methods
and doctrine were eagerly studied, especially since they revealed that much
remained to be done in terms of training, with particular problems highlighted.
In January 1942 the BGS Eighth Army directed: ‘Every opportunity will be
taken to carry out training ... so as to develop an established technique in this
type of operation, and to ensure that different units can carry it out in.
combination even of they have not had an opportunity of training together
beforehand.’ To assist in instruction a Training Branch at GHQ Middle East was
set up under Maj. Gen. John Harding, which set up and ran several training
establishments teaching the lessons of the Desert War. Middle East Command
also produced a series of Middle East Training Pamphlets to meet the
demand for the latest up-to-date information, although technically in-theatre
publications were forbidden by the War Office to prevent confusion and
diversion from official sources of information. Several desert training areas
were developed near Ismailia, Port Tewfik and the Pyramids for collective
training by larger formations, especially those new to the theatre of war.

The ability to train formations before being committed to battle remained a
luxury denied British High Command for most of 1941-42. Given the high
tempo of operations for much of the Desert War and constant demands for
fresh troops and equipment after heavy losses in battle, most new formations
were thrown into battle as soon as they deployed in North Africa. Pleas to give
them the three months collective training under desert conditions was simply
ignored. Much, therefore, still had to be learned the hard and costly way - in
battle. The inexperienced and poorly trained 1st Armoured Division was
quickly destroyed south-east of Agedabia, for example, when DAK struck back
after Crusader. The British High Command knew what was needed, but an

======================================================================

======================================================================

opportunity to effect real and meaningful changes and remedy the continuing
training deficit was largely denied them. The hurly burly of the Desert War
simply robbed British commanders at all levels of a sufficiently long quiet
inactive period for rest, reflection and training. While some meaningful
instruction was carried out by some motivated commanders of formations
cout of the line for rest it was not enough. Indeed, not everyone was clear
about what was happening and how to correct battlefield mistakes. Logistical
problems and shortages of equipment hampered training efforts. Petrol
shortages and fear of wear and tear to vehicles was also a problem.

The Eighth Army Montgomery inherited in August 1942 had made
considerable progress in improving overall training standard, but was still in
need of work. Indeed, the new GOC quickly judged his troops as being
‘somewhat untrained’ with the result that he scaled back his original plans for
his offensive as he feared he might be asking too much of them. Following
the Battle of Alam Halfa Montgomery had an opportunity denied previous
commanders of Eighth Army to carry out a period of rigorous training needed
to prepare for the offensive that drove the Axis out of Egypt and Libya. In
some respects the scope of training required was more limited given the
breakthrough battle planned. As a result, with only a short time before battle
began, he insisted it focused on the type of battle that lay ahead at El Alamein.
To do so the armoured divisions and New Zealand Division in 10th Corps
were withdrawn behind the lines, but the remainder were tied down in the
forward defences at El Alamein. To give them some instruction, a complex
system of reliefs was arranged a brigade at a time. The importance of combined-
arms training was clearly recognized by the new GOC. In an Army Training
Memorandum issued on 30 August 1942 he directed: ‘It cannot be emphasised
too strongly that successful battle operations depend on the intimate
co-operation of all arms, whether in armoured or unarmoured formations.
Ianks alone are never the answer; no one arm, alone and unaided can do any
good in battle.’ Great attention was paid to passing through minefields at
night. An Eighth Army Minefield Clearance School was formed to study and
train for this specialized task.

The careful training carried out before Second El Alamein built enormous
confidence and in turn reaped enormous dividends throughout the remainder
of the Desert War. Training remained an ongoing process as new lessons were
learnt. By the end of the war in North Africa Eighth Army had achieved a
new confidence, professionalism and skill it had never possessed before, which
stood it in good stead for the invasion of Sicily and the Italian campaign.

Weapons and equipment

Dress

The officers and men serving initially in Western Desert Force were largely
indistinguishable from other British Army units serving in tropical garrisons,
wearing standard British tropical uniform - sola topis, spine pads as protection
from the sun, baggy shorts, and 37-pattern webbing and equipment. By the
time Eighth Army was formed in September 1941 the exigencies of living,
moving and fighting in an arid desert environment, with its extremes of heat
and cold and dust that permeated everywhere, however, had led to widespread
modifications in uniform and considerable ad-hoc adaptations. Sun helmets
and other items of normal issue, for example, were rapidly abandoned and
replaced with far more practical, lightweight and serviceable clothing. As a
result an Eighth Army soldier often wore (with considerable pride) a sloppy
lived-in outfit that could only loosely be described as ‘uniform’

The greatest variation in uniform was perhaps in headgear, reflecting the
disparate countries of origin of many troops and regimental traditions. Officers
had the greatest free rein to experiment when it came to uniform. Many
removed stiffeners from caps to give a ‘lived-in’ look. A wide range of headgear
existed from the black berets of tank crews, Australian slouch hats, Gurkha
bush hats, khaki turbans of Sikhs and the small-brimmed pitch sun helmet
worn by South Africans. Within the British Army headgear also varied
enormously depending on regimental traditions, such as the Balmoral hat
worn by some Highland regiments. On active service steel helmets were

,inted sand yellow and sometimes covered with string camouflage nets or
ssian to break up the outline and prevent shine.
The standard regulation issue khaki drill shirt and shorts often formed the
basis of the uniform worn by Eighth Army soldiers of all nationalities in the
|d, but a wide variation in other clothing was worn, such as battledress, thick
coats, sleeveless leather or sheepskin vests and wool pullovers at night and
during cold spells. Superfluous equipment was simply left behind (such as
rge, cumbersome and heavy packs and anti-gas protective equipment). Items
of uniform worn reflected the disparate countries of origin and even traditional
ems of uniform belonging to regiments of the British Army, with items of
national equipment/uniform supplementing standard issue. Troops from some
dominions initially wore slightly outdated service dress, for example, but this
was soon abandoned as new equipment was issued from British stocks. Other
accoutrements included corduroy trousers, shaggy sheepskin coats and brightly
coloured scarves. Particular items of kit were issued for the desert, including
cellophane sand goggles. Distinctive Arab-style keffiyah scarves proved highly
practical and popular amongst officers and men. Footwear varied enormously
from the heavy ammunition boot worn by ORs to the flexible soft suede ‘desert
boots’ with rubber soles adopted by many officers

Weapons

The infantry battalions serving in Eighth Army during the Desert War

employed standard British weapons, including the .38 revolver, the bolt-action
303 short magazine Lee-Enfield rifle with long sword bayonet, small numbers
f 45in. Thompson sub-machine guns and the bipod-mounted .303 Bren light

machine gun.

The .38 revolver formed the standard sidearm available to officers and tank
crews. Although having an extremely limited effective range - about 25 yards

it was a workmanlike weapon for close-range fighting. The tried and tested
venerable short magazine Lee-Enfield rifle Mk III, with a 16in. sword bayonet,
originally introduced into British service in 1903, remained standard issue
during the early war years. With an effective range of up to 3,000 yards this
highly accurate, rugged and extremely reliable weapon was probably the
finest, manually operated, bolt-action rifle in the world. With a muzzle velocity
of 2,440 ft/sec, its .303in. bullet had great stopping power, and in the hands
of a marksman could fire effectively at long range. Although only having a
ten-round magazine, in skilled hands a high rate of fire was achieved of up to

5 rounds a minute.

The Thompson M28 sub-machine gun or ‘Tommy-gun’, capable of
providing a devastating volume of short-range fire, was also widely issued to
NCOs, Instead of 50-round drum magazines, which were prone to jamming,
more reliable 20-round box magazines were employed that were also easier to
carry in web equipment. A small supply of Sten SMGs, first produced in June

941, trickled through towards the end of the Desert War.

The superb, highly effective .303-calibre gas-operated Bren light machine
gun provided the main source of portable firepower used by infantry sections
and could fire single rounds or full automatic bursts. Indeed, given the
poor performance of other infantry weapons, it formed the main source of
firepower. Based on a Czech design developed at Brno and later manufactured
at Enfield (hence the name), this extremely reliable automatic weapon
weighed in at 23 Ib. and was fitted with a bipod for greater accuracy at ranges
up to 550m. With a magazine of 30 rounds this highly accurate automatic
weapon had a crew of two — one to fire the weapon and a second to carry
further magazines filled with ammunition, tools, and spares. A single Bren
gun was carried in combat by each infantry section, and with a practical
rate of fire of 120 rounds a minute provided a powerful and highly accurate
source of firepower.

The types of grenades carried by the infantry included the No. 36 bomb or
Mills bomb, No. 69 concussion grenade, and No. 77 phosphorous grenade used
to produce a smoke screen. Depending on the individual No. 36 grenades could
be thrown around 25 yards and were highly effective. Fitted with a discharger
cup and firing a ballistite cartridge, special SMLEs were retained to fire No. 36
grenades up to 200 yards.

The main source of close-quarter, indirect-fire support at the disposal of
infantry platoons was the lightweight 2in. mortar, firing smoke, high explos
and illumination rounds. This highly effective weapon consisted of little more
than a short tube, a simple firing mechanism and a base plate. It was operated
hand-held with the spade or base plate held firmly against the ground. A round
was fired by dropping the shell down the short barrel after which the angle was
readjusted for the next shot. It had a maximum range of 500 yards, although
it had far greater accuracy up to 300 yards.

The bolt-operated .5in, Boyes anti-tank rifle provided the only anti-armour
weapon in Commonwealth infantry battalions up to the spring of 1942 (anti.
tank guns were operated by the RA). Although man-portable, its heavy weight
(36 Ib.), length (72in.), limited effectiveness against all but the most lightly
armoured vehicle even at close range, and powerful recoil when fired made
it an unpopular weapon from the start and many were simply abandoned,
Indeed, Eighth Army Staff could not find a single example of it being employed
successfully against German AFVs following the Operation Crusader offensive.
Its obvious limitations largely accounted for infantry units to employ sticky
bombs, captured enemy weapons and increasingly lay mines, which proved a
novel and increasingly essential weapon.

The main source of organic fire support came from the Vickers machine
gun and 3in, mortar in each infantry battalion. The venerable tripod-mounted
and belt-fed (but still highly effective and reliable) water-cooled .303 Vickers
medium machine gun was capable of producing a greater volume of sustained
small-arms fire than any other infantry weapon, It could fire at a rate of up to

500 rounds a minute directly or indirectly at ranges up to 3,000 yards, but was
extremely heavy at 88.5 Ib. It was fired by a crew of two men ~ one to fire the
weapon and a second to ensure the smooth feeding of its belt of ammunition.
4 total of four men, however, were needed to move the gun, its tripod,
ammunition, spare parts and the water needed to cool the weapon.

[he 3in. mortar fired smoke and HE bombs at high trajectory into enemy
positions. It consisted of a hollow tube with a firing pin at its bottom, a bipod
stand and heavy base plate to absorb recoil. This comparatively crude heavy
weapon could be broken down and manhandled in three loads during an
assault, but a major drawback was that each bomb weighed 10 Ib. With a range
of up to 2.5km and a maximum rate of 15 rounds a minute when used by a
well-trained crew, it was a powerful source of indirect fire support.

Armour

The armoured regiments serving in Eighth Army employed a wide variety
of different AFVs during the Desert War, nearly all of which were severely
criticized by the British crews that operated them largely due to poor
mechanical reliability and repeated defeats at German hands. It would be
dangerous and misleading, however, to accept that inferiority in quality of
British tanks was the simple cause of British battlefield failure, as crews at
the time and some historians have argued. Eighth Army generally enjoyed
superiority in tank numbers, moreover, especially when replacements are
factored into the equation, than its Axis opponents for much of the Desert
War. Contrary to myth the British enjoyed a qualitative advantage in many
respects, with indeed an advantage in both quality and quantity swinging
relentlessly to the Allied side. Only in one respect did the 2-pdr main gun
armament for most early British tanks enjoy a marked disadvantage, since this
gun was incapable of firing an HE round so badly needed to suppress Axis anti-
tank guns. The often poorly designed equipment used by the RAC resulted
from decisions made about tank procurement and design before the outbreak
of World War II, which resulted in the development of two distinct classes of
tank: cruiser and infantry, with very different thickness of armour, weight and
top speed. The General Staff decided the main role of tanks was to fight tanks,
and to do it a cruiser tank with optimum anti-tank capability and capable of
carrying out fast-moving mobile operations was needed, with speed gained at
the expense of armoured protection. A far slower and heavily armoured AFV
was also needed, trained and intended to act in the role of supporting infantry
attacks, which largely prejudiced its use in any other role. Close-support
variants of both types of tank were also produced armed with 3in. howitzers,
having a 1,000-yard range capable of firing HE and smoke shells, in place of
an anti-tank gun.

The various marks of British-made cruiser tanks deployed by Eighth Army
from November 1941 onwards were all the products of over hasty design and
decisions made long before the outbreak of war. All fast light cruiser tanks —
Cruiser Tank Mk 1 (A9), Cruiser Tank Mk II (A10), Cruiser Tank Mk IV and
IVA (A13) and new Cruiser Tank Mk VI (A15) Crusader I - proved far too
weakly armoured for a modern battlefield and were all extremely vulnerable
to German tanks, AT guns, and later Italian weapons. They were, moreover,
extremely unreliable mechanically, often resulting in the total loss of the
vehicle after a breakdown, and all were prone to burst into flames quickly. All
the older models were suffering from general debility by the time of Operation
Crusader. Indeed, during this fighting the remaining serviceable A10s had to
be carried on transporters and had only a top speed of 16mph and just 30mm
of armour. The A15 Cruiser tank or Crusader II, arriving in-theatre in mid 1941,
was marginally better than its predecessors, having the same gun and two
Besa MGs, a top speed of 26mph and 40mm of armour. Unfortunately like its
predecessors it was still mechanically unreliable. The greatest defect of all these

‘Operation Battleaxe and was

Unfortunately it displayed many of
the shortcomings of early British
cruiser tanks having only a 2-pdr
main armament, thin armour
(40-50mm) and poor mechanical
reliability. It had a maximum speed
of 27.5 mph and a maximum range
cof 200 miles. It was quickly
outclassed by new German tanks,
but remained in service despite its
‘obvious problems. Like other British
cruiser and infantry tanks, close-
support version was also deployed
armed with a 3in. howitzer.A 6-pdr

during the summer of 1942 and
remained in use until the end of

1941. (4700-32 E 7002)

British cruiser tanks was the main armament. While 2-pdr AT rounds could
penetrate the turret, sides and rears of all German tanks, they could not defeat
the frontal armour, especially after it was face-hardened during 1942. The other
main drawback was it lacked an HE round, making it ineffective against
soft targets. At the time of Operation Crusader the 2 Ib. was slightly superior in
armour-piercing performance to the guns carried by most German tanks, but
this advantage was steadily lost as German tanks up-gunned and up-armoured.
Since they were underpowered it proved extremely difficult to simply up-
armour them or add a larger and more powerful main armament, although a
6 Ib. variant ~ the Crusader III - was introduced during the summer of 1942 in
time for the Battle of El Alamein, The handful of close-support cruiser tanks
in each regiment, armed with mortars with a range of 1,000 yards, proved
insufficient in number and less effective than the German 75mm in the Mk IV
Panzer, and were themselves vulnerable to German anti-tank guns.

‘The Eighth Army employed two types of infantry tank (issued to Army Tank
Brigades), during the Desert War, both of which were slow, unreliable and had
a very short range before refuelling. The heavily armoured Matilda II, armed
with a 2-pdr gun as main armament and a coaxial Besa MG, had proved a
highly effective infantry support tank in the early stages of the Desert War,

======================================================================
PAGE 49
======================================================================

although like cruisers its combat effectiveness was largely limited by its
inability to fire an HE shell. This heavily armoured tank - with armour up to
78mm thick (greater than any German tank) — weighed in at 26.5 tons and
1a maximum speed of 15 miles per hour. Until the deployment of German
50mm PAK guns and the dual-purpose 88mm it was the undisputed queen of
the battlefield, being virtually invulnerable to standard enemy anti-tank
weapons. A very limited radius of action - approximately 40 miles before
refuelling was needed - and very poor mechanical reliability badly undermined
its battlefield effectiveness. The Matilda's replacement - the Valentine -
possessed armour 65mm thick, had a 2-pdr gun and a coaxial Besa MG and a
maximum speed of 15 mph. It weighed in at 17 tons. Until some 6-pdr variants
appeared at the end of the Desert War it did not comprise a major advance,
suffering the same problems as the Matilda, and for a while was used as both a
cruiser and an infantry tank given shortages of other AFVs.

The introduction of various types of far better designed US AFVs gave RAC
units a far better fighting chance during the later stages of the Desert War. The
first US-made tank to enter service was the M3 Stuart light tank ~ christened the
‘Honey’ by British tank crews, delighted by its many virtues compared to British
cesigns; it proved an extremely welcome addition to armoured units and first saw

in service when early models began

Eighth Army in April/May 1942,

in terms of armoured protection,
reliability and firepower. Originally
intended as an infantry support
tank, the Grant had a curious
design. The Grant had a turret-
mounted 37mm gun similar to the
Stuart Light tank, in addition to a
75mm gun in a hull sponson capable
of firing both HE and AP rounds.
This weapon at last gave tank crews
a weapon that could outrange and
penetrate the frontal armour on
enemy tanks, as well as engage
hostile anti-tank guns with a

real prospect of suppressing

or destroying them.A significant
drawback, however, was the Grant
could not engage from hull-down
positions, and it had a very high
profile making it also difficult to
hide from view. (4700-32 E 8475)

service in Operation Crusader in the role of a cruiser tank. This fast-moving AFV
(capable of up to 40 mph), armed with a 37mm main gun comparable to the
2-pdr in performance, was far more mechanically reliable than British light
tanks. A major drawback, however, was that its thin armour (1.Sin.) limited its
usefulness in direct engagements against German main battle tanks.

The M3 or General Grant tank — first deployed in May 1942 during the
fighting at Gazala — was a massive improvement over every design previously
employed by Eighth Army. Originally designed as an infantry support tank, the
Grant was armed with a turret-mounted 37mm gun (like that in the Honey)
and a 75mm main gun mounted in a sponson on the right-hand side of the
hull capable of firing both 14 Ib. AP and HE rounds. It was the first British tank
during World War II to mount a dual purpose anti-tank/anti-personnel gun,
giving the RAC at last a weapon capable of engaging both hostile battle tanks
and anti-tank guns. The Grant's frontal armour ~ up to 2.25in. thick ~ was
proof against the short 50mm tank gun at 250 yards and against the long
50mm at 1,000 yards, but its own gun could penetrate armour of all German
AFVs as far out as 850 yards and certainly at 650 yards Although slower and
less manoeuvrable than its German counterparts — it weighed 26.75 tons fully
loaded — it proved highly effective from Gazala onwards. A major drawback,
however, was that the main armament in the sponson had limited traverse and
it prevented the AFV taking up hull-down defensive positions.

The M4 Sherman tank was by far the best tank deployed by Eighth Army
during the Desert War. It was first deployed in British service at the Battle of El
Alamein and had all the same virtues as the Grant in terms of speed (maximum
23mph), 75mm armour and great mechanical reliability, but also had the
massive advantage of having its 7smm main armament mounted in a rotating
turret, along with a coaxial MG. This gave this 29.5-ton AFV far greater tactical
flexibility and it could engage hostile AT guns from the safety of hull-down
positions at ranges of up to 2,700 yards using HE rounds. Its only drawback
was that its armour (up to 75mm) was bettered by enemy anti-tank weapons
of SOmm and above, and when hit was prone to burst into flames due to
ammunition stored in the turret and its petrol fuel.
