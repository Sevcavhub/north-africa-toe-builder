BATTLEGROUP •  RULES YOUR BATTLE GROUP In order to play, you are going to  need a battlegroup  .  Collecting and  painting miniatures is a large part of the  wargaming hobby, and as such building  up this collection can become something  of  life’s work for dedicated (obsessive)  wargamers (author included here)  .   The theatre supplements each include  different ‘types’ of army, the principal  combatants of war at that time, and each  has its own advantages, disadvantages  and ‘style’ of player  .  You’ll learn the  ins and outs as you go, but suffice to  say, infantry-based forces, often backed  up by artillery, will fight very different  battles to mobile armoured units with  lots of tanks  .   The heart of your hobby is your  collection of miniatures, but this should  not be confused with your battlegroup  .   A battlegroup is small combined-arms  force created for a specific game. Your  collection will be far larger, and include  many different units  .  You won’t use  them all every game, but occasionally  you will be able to get them all out  and have a really big battle  .  As most  wargamers find, their collection is rarely  complete, there is always something  to add or new models to include  .  If,  by some good fortune, an army is  completed, then invariably they start on  another one  . ARMY LISTS, POINTS AND  BATTLE RATING The theatre supplement’s army lists  contain a lot of different units, from  infantry squads and tanks, to command  units, signal teams, artillery, medics, etc  .   Each is listed with a points value and a  battle rating  . Points values are how you pick a force  .   In simplistic terms, the higher the points  value, the ‘better’ the unit  .  A powerful  tank with a big gun is worth more  than an infantryman with a mere rifle.  Heavy artillery is worth more than light  artillery  .  When picking a force, it will be  to a maximum points value, set by the  players before the game  .  If both sides  have an equal number of points, then  you will get an even game (well, that is  the theory)  .  Of course, how you use the  force, your luck on the day, and lots of  other factors will ultimately decide who  gets the victory  . Units also have a battle rating  .  This  is discussed in detail later, but a  unit’s battle rating is a gauge of the  effectiveness and importance of your  battlegroup, and will be very important  in deciding whether you win or lose  a game  .  See page 43 for full details on  battle rating  . NOTES ON INFANTRY BASING How infantry are based doesn’t really  have an impact on the game, as long as  it is obvious which squad the models  belong to, then any basing method  will work  .  Individual basing obviously  allows for the easy removal of casualties,  but multiple basing allows for faster  movement and easy identification. If  using multiple bases, the best thing to  do is also have a few markers or small  dice to show casualties sustained by  the base. So, a five man base would  remain on the table until all five men  have become casualties, but after four  casualties would only have a Rate of Fire  of 1  .  This additional bookkeeping won’t  affect game play at all  .  A combination  of multiple bases and single figures is  probably the best compromise  .    GAME SIZE This game is designed to be played at  four different sizes, from small squad  vs squad actions up to larger battalion  actions  .  The larger the game, the more  miniatures you’ll need, as well as a  correspondingly larger tabletop  .  Below is  a guideline for the minimum, maximum  and standard recommended points  required for the different sized games, as  well as a recommended table size  . Game Size    Minimum   Maximum    ‘Standard’    20mm    15mm   Points   Points    Points   table size   table size Squad   100   350   250   6' x 4'   4' x 4'   Platoon   351   750   500   6' x 6'   6' x 4' Company   751   1250   1000   6' x 8'   6' x 6' Battalion   1251   2000+   1500   6' x 10'    6' x 8'           or larger   or larger 10

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES THE RULES penetration operations  made the tactics of World  War I redundant  .  Better  tanks and tactics, from the  lessons learnt in Poland,  would see the French and  British armoured forces  outmatched in 1940  .  North  Africa would see the British  Army learn these lessons  and, despite early defeats, eventually  match German tactics with their own  .   Later, when the US Army entered that  theatre, they soon found their own  inexperienced tank crews struggling  against the panzers  .  But the US Army  had its own distinct advantages to bring  to bear – their war industries could keep  their forces far better supplied with  replacements, fuel and ammunition, all  equally vital (if not more so) to victory  .   If these rules only concerned themselves  with crew skill, vehicle specifications  and battlefield tactics then the US Army  in North Africa might never win a  game  .  But they did win, and drove the  Germans out  .  So these rules will give the  US some of their national advantages,  and make those advantages worthwhile  using, to the point that it balances the  other factors  .  Two different armies;  one small, well-equipped and well- experienced, one larger, inexperienced  and lacking cutting edge equipment,  can then still fight a balanced, and  historically more accurate, game  .   The same can said for other theatres  too  .  From the mass conscript armies  of the Soviet Union, with seemingly  inexhaustible resources to expend, to the  last desperate defenders of Germany,  poorly trained and seemingly without  a hope against the odds facing them, a  historical balance can be found  .   CHARACTER AND BALANCE IN  WORLD WAR II BATTLES The reason why Battlegroup exists is to  try and infuse World War II wargames  with more historical character  .   Obviously, some elements are common  to all the battlefields of the war. From  the Pacific to North Africa and Western  Europe, the presence of tanks, infantry,  artillery and (mostly) aircraft are a given,  but they weren’t always available in the  same numbers, or deployed with the  same tactics  .   To help explain further we’ll use the  example of tanks  .  Tanks, and the appeal  of fighting tank battles, is really the  biggest draw towards playing World  War II wargames  .  This is not to say that  great games can’t be played with just  infantry, but World War II was the war  of the tank  .   Tank warfare developed  rapidly and beyond all recognition over  the course of six years of fighting. In  1939, the tank was still in its infancy,  with many nations reliant on the tactics  developed in World War I, or some  having yet to develop any tanks at all  .   By 1945, tanks design had turned those  first slow, cumbersome and under- armed vehicles (and the small, fast and  under-armoured ones) into fearsome  behemoths with far thicker armour,  more powerful guns and better engines  .   Of course the rules need to represent  this, in detail – and they do, using  each vehicle’s individual stat line (just  like other Wold War II games)  .  But the  doctrines for the use of tanks had also  changed, and not just generally, but  specifically for each nation.  Mechanised warfare was in its infancy  when the German Army unleashed their  blitzkrieg  on Poland in September 1939  .   The age of lightning attacks and deep  The fearsome Tiger I 11

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES T HE  T URN &  O RDERS THE TURN Battlegroup is played in turns  .  The  players take it in turns to command  their forces, issue orders and resolve  those orders, before the turn passes to  their opponent, who then repeats the  sequence with their own forces  .  There  are exceptions to this rule, but in general  the game works by both players taking a  ‘go’, one after the other  .   Each player’s turn is played out in order,  following the steps below  . 1. Roll Orders Dice Roll the number of D6 determined by  the game size, and add the number of  officers in the battle-group. 2. Issue First Order Choose any unit and issue it an order  .   Resolve the order before moving to  the next unit  . 3. Issue Second Order Choose another unit and issue it  an order  .  Resolve the order before  moving to the next unit  . 4. Issue Third Order, etc... Choose another unit and issue it  an order  .  Resolve the order before  moving to the next unit  .  Continue  this process until all orders have been  issued  . 5. Rally Remove pinning markers from  pinned units (see later)  .   Once a player has removed any pinning,  the turn passes to his opponent,  beginning again at step 1  .   ORDERS, OFFICERS    AND REACTIONS Each turn a commander (that’s you)  can issue a pre-determined number of  orders  .  The orders are determined at  the start of the turn by rolling dice  .  The  number of dice is determined by the  size of game  .  Small games use fewer  dice than larger ones, because you have  fewer units needing orders  .  Games are  split into four different sizes  .  Squad- level, Platoon-level, Company-level and  Battalion-level, determined by the points  values of the battlegroups involved  .   Squad   1D6 Platoon   2D6 Company   3D6 Battalion   4D6 As well as the dice roll, the player also  adds to this score his battlegroup’s  Above: A Red Army observer team watch for the  approach of the enemy from their trench (Novosti 851334)  US senior officer unit 12

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES total number of officers. These are the  men running the battle and passing  on the orders, so the more officers in  a battlegroup, the more effective a  fighting force will be at disseminating  information and getting units into  action  .  So, if a battlegroup includes three  officers in a platoon-level game, then the  player would roll 2D6 and add 3 to the  total  .  In a Battalion-level game he would  roll 4D6 and add 3  .   Whilst creating your battlegroup you  will need to keep a note of how many  officers your battlegroup includes. If,  during the course of the battle, you lose  officers to enemy fire, or from morale  effects, then the officer total will go  down – obviously officers that have  been killed, wounded or are otherwise  indisposed by enemy fire can’t do much  to help run the battle, so you suffer the  results  . REACTION ORDERS This is a battle, and each side is seeking  to destroy the other  .  Your units cannot  expect to move around the battlefield  without attracting the attention of the  enemy  .  An alert enemy will react to  your movement and firing, often by  firing back! This is covered by Reaction  Orders  .   In your turn you can issue your units  one of the two Reaction Orders, either  Ambush Fire or Reserve Move  .  These  allow that unit to take its order in your  opponent’s turn, missing your current  turn in order to wait, see what happens  and react to it (hence the name)  .   You can issue as many Reaction Orders  as you wish and your orders total allows,  but be warned, an over-use of Reaction  Orders will hand the initiative in the  battle to your opponent, and he will  be dictating where, when and how the  battle happens  .  Conversely, do not ignore  Reaction Orders; they are very useful  and add a different dynamic to the game  .   Well-used they are very powerful and  can have a big effect on the outcome of a  battle  .  You will need to strike a balance  between attack and defence, but how  you do this is left up to you  . 13 Reaction Orders are only ever used in  the opponent’s turn  .  See ‘Using Reaction  Orders’ later for full details. Suffice to  say here that just because it is your turn,  it doesn’t mean the enemy has to sit  around and do nothing! Example of Orders: It is a Company-level game, with four  officers on player A’s side and three on  player B’s side. In player A’s turn he will roll 3D6 and add  4 for his orders total. He rolls 2, 3 and 5. So  he will have (2+3+5+4 officers) or 14 orders  to issue. In player B’s turn he will also roll 3D6 and  add 3. He rolls 1, 4 and 4. He will have 12  orders to issue, (1+4+4+3 officers).

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES ISSUING ORDERS Once the commander has determined  the number of orders he can issue, he  can set about using them  .  Orders allow  units to act, generally by moving and  shooting (although there are some  special orders as well to deal with other  battlefield situations).  To issue an order, the commander  simply selects a unit and says what  order they are to receive  .  That unit  then acts upon the order and, once it is  complete, the commander moves on to  nominate the next unit for an order, and  declares what it is  .  This continues until  all his allowed orders have been issued  .   During play, it is easiest if the opposing  player keeps track of the orders,  counting them off as they are issued,  until there are none left  . A unit can only be issued a single order  per turn, so once it has had its orders  for this turn, it can’t have another  .   Also, a unit which is pinned cannot be  issued any order, as it is currently too  busy avoiding being shot at to take any  constructive part in the battle  .   When there are no orders left to be  issued, or the commander does not wish  to issue any more orders, the orders  phase is over and the turn moves on to  the Rally phase  . Note: The easiest way to track orders is  to use dice, with the opponent turning  the dice as the orders are used up  .   USING REACTION ORDERS The orders sequence detailed above can  (and will) be interrupted by Reaction  Orders, either Ambush Fire or Reserve  Movement  .  As with other orders, a unit  can be issued a Reaction Order in its  own turn, but cannot do so if pinned  .   Any unit that is issued a Reaction Order  will not act in its own turn, but will wait,  and act by interrupting the enemy’s  turn  . A unit can act on its Reaction Order at  any point in the enemy’s turn  .  It can  jump in straight away, before a single  enemy unit has been given an order,  or it can wait until the very end, before  the Rally phase starts  .  It can also be  used to interupt an enemy unit’s order,  midway through a move or firing before  an enemy unit opens fire itself. This  freedom of action makes reaction orders  very useful  .   If a unit with a reaction order becomes  pinned before it has acted, then it cannot  now act, but it retains its order for when  it becomes unpinned  . ORDERS Issuing orders is the way a commander  gets his units to do things, like move  and shoot  .  It is the basic mechanism  that drives the game  .  After selecting an  unpinned  unit, a commander can issue  it a single order from the list below  . •  Manoeuvre and Fire The unit will move into position then  open fire. It may make a single move,  up to its full normal movement  distance (see Movement later) and  then take a single shot at an enemy  unit (see Open Fire!)  .   This can be any type of shot with any  available weapon  . •  Fire and Manoeuvre Same as above, but the unit will fire  before it moves. Take the shot first  (again any type of fire, with any  weapon), and then move up to the  unit’s full movement distance  . •  Top Speed The unit must move fast  .  It can  move up to twice its full movement  distance, but may not do anything  else; it’s moving flat-out. •  Open Fire! The unit will hold its position and lay  down heavy fire. The unit may fire  at the enemy twice, but must remain  stationary whilst doing so  .  The unit  can use any type of fire, with any  available weapons it has, and can  target the same enemy unit twice, or  two different enemy units, as long as  they are both in its arc of fire and line  of sight  .  Declare both targets before  rolling any dice  . •  Disembark/Embark A transport vehicle carrying  passengers will move then any  passengers units it wishes may  disembark  .  The transport vehicle may  move up to its normal movement  allowance, and then place any  disembarking units within 4" of  its final position. Alternatively, the  passengers can disembark first, then  the transport vehicle can move  .  If the  commander so chooses, he may elect  not to move the transport vehicle  at all, but open fire once instead of  moving  . To enter a transport vehicle, the  reverse is used  .  A unit within 4" of the  vehicle can embark after the vehicle  has made a standard move, or the  vehicle can make a standard move  after the infantry have embarked  .   •  Unlimber/Limber A transport vehicle towing a gun  will move then unlimber the gun  .   The towing vehicle may move up  to its normal movement allowance,  and then place the gun, and any  crew, within 4" of its final position.  Alternatively, the gun can be  unlimbered first, then the towing  vehicle moved  .  If the commander so  chooses, he may elect not to move  the towing vehicle at all, but fire the  vehicle’s weaponry once instead  . To limber a gun the reverse of  unlimber is used  .  A gun within 4" of  the vehicle can be limbered after the  vehicle has made a standard move,  or the vehicle can make a standard  move after the gun has limbered  . 14

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES •  Infantry Close Assault An Infantry unit will attempt to move  to within Close Assault range (5") and  engage the enemy in a Close Assault,  with pistols, grenades, bayonets,  rifle butts, etc. In order to press a  Close Assault, first roll a D6 to see if  the unit are ready and willing to get  stuck-in  . Unit Experience Test Inexperienced   4+ Regular   3+ Veteran   2+ Elite   2+ If they pass, continue the Assault  Order  .  If they fail, the unit does  nothing and is marked as pinned  . To press the assault, the infantry unit  (note, that vehicles and gun crews  can’t use the Close Assault order) may  move up to its normal movement  allowance (5"), and then conduct an  assault against a single enemy unit  .   Only by using the Close Assault order  does an infantry unit gain the Close  Assault bonuses (see later for full  rules)  .  If an infantry unit just uses the  Manoeuvre and Fire order to approach  the enemy, then he can still fire, but  this is treated as normal firing, with no  assault bonuses  .   Close Assault is also used for infantry  to attack enemy vehicles with  anti-tank grenades (see page 34 for  details)  .   •  Request Artillery Fire A unit with the Artillery Spotter  or Mortar Spotter special rule will  request indirect mortar or artillery  fire. The unit may not do anything  else this turn, as it calls in target  information and grid references and  corrects fall of shot  .  See Indirect  Artillery Fire for full details of how to  resolve this order  .   •  Tactical Co-Ordination Only a unit with the Senior Officer  special rule can be given the Tactical  Co-ordination order  .  The command  unit can then do nothing this turn,  but may nominate a friendly, pinned  unit to attempt to remove its pinned  marker  .  Take a Battle Counter  .  The  pinned unit must then pass a unit  experience test (as given under  infantry Close Assaults)  . •  Re-arm Only a unit with the Re-Supply  special rule can be given the Re-arm  order  .  The Re-Supply unit can do  nothing this turn, but any friendly  unit in contact with it can be re- supplied with new ammunition  . •  Engineering Only a unit with the Engineer special  rule can be given the Engineering  order  .  The engineers can use this  order to place their demolition  charges or remove minefields (see  Engineers later for details)  .  A unit can  do nothing else in the turn it is given  the Engineering order  . •  Repair Only a unit with the Repair special  rule can be given the Repair order  .   The unit can do nothing this turn, but  may attempt to roll to repair a single  immobilised or destroyed vehicle  . •  Recover Only a unit with the Recovery special  rule can be given the Recover order  .   The unit can do nothing this turn,  but next turn may begin to tow a  destroyed or immobilised vehicle,  moving at half its normal speed  .    •  Ambush Fire (Reaction Order) Mark the unit with a counter or  dice (or any other obvious marker)  .   The waiting ambush unit may now  interrupt any enemy unit’s order in  their next turn to use the Open Fire!  order  . The Ambush Fire is treated exactly as  the Open Fire! order, so the ambusher  can fire twice, using any type of fire  (or combination of types of fire) and  can also target two separate enemy  units (in range and line of sight)  .   Resolve the fire as normal. Ambush  Fire cannot be used with Indirect  Artillery, Mortar fire or Infantry Close  assaults  .   The marker is only removed once the  unit opens fires, or if the commander  chooses to remove it and give the unit  another order instead  .   •  Reserve Move (Reaction Order) A unit given the Reserve Move order  does not move in its own turn but  instead waits, and can then interrupt  the enemy turn (but not an order) to  take the Top Speed order, allowing it  to immediately make a double move,  using the normal movement rules  . The marker is only removed once  the unit moves, or if the commander  chooses to remove it and give the unit  another order instead  .   RALLY The last part of player’s turn is to rally  pinned troops  .  Units marked as pinned  can have their pinned markers removed,  thus getting them back in the battle  . To do this, the player must take a battle  counter from the pot  .  For each counter  taken, they may remove a D6 markers  from any pinned units he wishes  .  If two  counters are taken then 2D6 counters  can be removed  .  If three counters are  taken, then 3D6 counters are removed  and so on  .  Declare this before taking any  counters  . A commander does not have to take any  counters, he can leave units pinned (and  thus save the battle rating), but he won’t  be able to issue orders to the unit until  he removes the pinned marker  . 15

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES ORDERS ROLL First the commanding player rolls his  orders dice  .  It is a platoon-sized game,  and his battlegroup has two officers. He  rolls 2D6, getting a 4 and a 5  .  He will  have a total of 11 orders to issue (4+5+2)  .   FIRST ORDER The commanding player issues a Top  Speed order to a Panzer III tank, and  it moves up to twice its movement  allowance  . SECOND ORDER A Manoeuvre then Fire order to a  second Panzer III tank, which moves  up to engage a distant T-34 with aimed  anti-tank fire.  REACTION ORDER  (AMBUSH FIRE) His opponent, seeing his T-34 in danger,  decides to use Ambush Fire set last turn,  with a 45mm anti-tank gun  .  He decides  to take two shots at the threatening  Panzer III  .  It misses twice! SECOND ORDER -  COMPLETED The Panzer III completes its remaining  movement then opens fire at the T-34,  also missing  . THIRD ORDER Deciding to cover his Panzer III’s  advance, he places the third tank of  the squadron on Ambush Fire, ready  to engage any emerging threat in his  opponent’s next turn  .   FOURTH ORDER Next, he orders his forward observer  team to request artillery fire, using  a 1st target priority artillery request  .   He makes the required roll, then the  communications check to talk to a  divisional 120mm mortar battery  .   He places his target marker, rolls for  deviation, then orders the mortars to fire  for effect! FIFTH ORDER The first 120mm mortar Opens Fire!    and fires twice.  SIXTH ORDER The second mortar Opens Fire!    and fires twice.  Note, these four shots   are all resolved together  .   SEVENTH ORDER Mortar rounds complete, the seventh  order of the turn is for the player to use  his battlegroup forward commander  for the Tactical Co-ordination order  .  A  PaK-40 crew and its loader team are  currently pinned, and he wants them to  engage some enemy T-34s  .  The PaK-40  crew are Regulars, so after taking a  Battle Counter, they need to take a unit  experience test on 3+  .  They pass, and the  pinning marker is removed  .   EIGHTH ORDER Now unpinned, the Pak-40 is given the  Open Fire! order  .  First it rolls for its  loader team to see if it can get an extra  shot  .  It rolls a 5, and passes  .  The Pak-40’s  three shots will be two aimed fire shots  with armour-piercing shells at two T-34s,  and thirdly HE shells for Area Fire at an  enemy machine-gun team  .   These shots are resolved one at a time,  destroying one T-34 and pinning the  machine-gun team – good shooting  .   NINTH ORDER The ninth unit to receive orders is  an SdKfz 251/1, which will get the  Disembark order  .  First it makes a normal  move, then the Panzer Grenadiers and  MG team inside leap out and are placed  within 4" of the vehicle  .  That completes  its order  . TENTH ORDER The dismounted Grenadiers and the  MG team are both now available to be  given orders  .  The MG team are given  the Open Fire! order and will use Area  Fire twice, targeting two enemy infantry  units ahead. In the blaze of MG fire, one  enemy infantry unit becomes pinned  .   ELEVENTH ORDER The last order of the turn  .  The player  opts for another Disembark order for  another SdKfz 251/1  .  This time, the  vehicle will give up its movement to  take a shot, and uses Area Fire with  its machine gun to target an enemy  anti-tank rifle team. Then the Panzer  Grenadier squad and MG team inside  are placed within 4" of the vehicle  . REACTION ORDER  (RESERVE MOVE) Before the turn ends, the Russian player  interrupts again to use a Reserve Move  order he placed last turn on a T-34  .  He  pushes this T-34 forward with double it’s  movement, ready to get into the battle  in his turn  .   RALLY Finally, the German commander decides  to take a single battle counter to remove  pinning  .  He currently has three pinned  units  .  He takes the counter, it’s a 3, and  places it in his stack  .  He rolls the D6 and  scores a 4  .  He removes all three pinned  markers and the spare is lost  .   This ends the turn  . . .  Over to    the Russians  . Panzer III L EXAMPLE OF A TURN 16

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES M OVEMENT E ach unit has its own movement  distance, how far it can move on the  tabletop expressed as inches. How much  of its potential movement can be used is  dictated by a unit’s orders, but most of  the time a unit can make a single move  of the distance stated. Infantry Movement Infantry are small and nimble (compared  to tanks) and can quickly find their way  around, over or through obstacles that  would impede vehicles. An infantry  unit can always move 5", and this is  not affected by any movement modifier  unless it is dangerous terrain (see page  18). This distance is also not affected  by whether the unit is on a road or  moving cross-country.  When moving,  an infantry model must begin and end  its move within 1" (approximately) of  another member of its unit.   Cavalry Movement Horses are fast, sometimes very fast, but  they can’t get into the places infantry  can. A cavalry unit can move up to 8".  This is increased to 10" if the unit is  on a road, because roads are generally  flat(ish) and provide decent footing.  Once per game, a cavalry unit can make  a special ‘Charge!’ move. This allows  the unit to increase its speed to 12" for  that turn, but once a cavalry unit has  charged, it cannot charge again. Cavalry  units are affected by difficult ground,  obstacles and dangerous ground. Horse Towed Gun    (and horse and cart) Not as fast or nimble as cavalry, a  horse towed gun, or a horse towed cart  (usually a supply unit) can move up  to 4" off road and 6" on a road, and is  affected by difficult ground, obstacles  and dangerous ground. Bicycle Some units were equipped with bicycles,  to speed their movement to combat (not  to fight from). A bicycle unit can move  up to 3" off road, but this is increased to  10" whilst they remain on a road. Manhandled Gun Guns without towing vehicles, or a horse  and limber, have to be pushed by their  crew – this is hard, slow work. How  far a gun can be moved is determined  by its size. Very Light guns can be  manhandled up to 3". Light guns can  be manhandled up to 2". Medium guns  can be manhandled up to 1", and Heavy  guns cannot be manhandled at all,  requiring a towing vehicle or horse and  limber because they are just too big.

This is the distance  a vehicle can move, depending upon  where it is. The road value can only be  used if the vehicle starts its movement  on a road and remains on a road for  its entire move, and represents the  vehicle’s maximum speed. Otherwise,  use the vehicle’s off-road movement  allowance. This distance takes into  account the vehicle type. So, a wheeled  vehicle might be fast on a road, but  will generally be slower off-road than  a tracked vehicle. Vehicles designed  for road travel (such as trucks, etc) will  find their off-road movement distances  severely restricted because they lack  the traction and suspension needed for  sustained off-road movement.  Aircraft Aircraft are, of course, very fast. An  aircraft has no movement distance;  instead it can move anywhere on the  tabletop it likes. TERRAIN EFFECTS Difficult Ground If any unit except infantry must move  through an area of difficult ground,  such as woods, marshes, broken or  rocky ground or piles of rubble, then  reduce its total movement distance by  a D6" per move it spends in the terrain.  A unit cannot be reduced to less than 1"  of movement, so it can’t be stationary.  If the dice roll indicates that the unit is  stationary, it can still struggle forwards 1".  Roll once for each move a unit makes in  difficult terrain. Obstacle If a unit must cross an obstacle, such as  a wall or a hedge, then again reduce its  total movement distance by D6". If the  reduction means the unit does not have  enough movement to cross the obstacle,  move it up to the obstacle instead. It can  roll again and cross the obstacle during  its next move. As with difficult ground, a  unit can always move at least 1". Dangerous Ground If a unit must move through an area of  dangerous terrain, such as over barbed  wire or through a minefield, across  scree-slopes etc, then it can only move  D6". The D6" result cannot exceed the  unit’s normal maximum speed, so an  infantry unit moving over or through  dangerous terrain that rolls a 6 does not  speed up, it moves its normal maximum  of 5" (they must have found a safe  route). Dangerous ground can also have  other effects on the unit (such as mines  going off), which are described in their  own rules. Impassable Terrain Some terrain, such as rivers or cliffs,  count as impassable. If a unit moves  into impassable terrain, then it counts  as destroyed. Note that some units  have special rules which allow them to  enter some impassable terrain, such as  amphibious units entering water, but  otherwise these terrain features just  block all movement. Vehicles Reversing Sometimes vehicles will want to reverse,  usually to back away from the enemy  whilst keeping their frontal armour  facing them. Reversing is treated as  crossing difficult ground, so reduce the  unit’s movement by D6", to a minimum  of 1". This is also affected by difficult  terrain or obstacles as normal. Entering and Exiting Buildings In order to enter a building, an infantry  unit must move so that the majority  of the unit is within 1" of the building  model (or its base). If a unit ends its  movement within 1" of the building,  then they can immediately be placed  inside the building.  In order to exit a building, an infantry  unit takes half its basic move, measured  from the building model (or its base), so  it can only move 2.5". VEHICLE PASSENGERS A transport vehicle carrying passengers  moves and fights as normal, and when  they move any passengers are naturally  carried with them. Once any passengers  have disembarked the vehicle, the  disembarked squad (or squads) become  separate units and must then be given  orders individually, until the passengers  re-embark.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Whilst being transported inside a  vehicle, an infantry squad or team  cannot Open Fire! They must disembark  first. A unit with the Artillery Spotter,  Mortar Spotter or Air Spotter special  rules may be given the relevant orders  whilst still embarked. Any passenger vehicle can be given a  special ‘Withdraw’ order. This is the  same as the Top Speed order, allowing  the vehicle to move twice its normal  distance. If the vehicle then ends its  move within 10" of a table edge it can  be removed from play. This allows  transport vehicles to deploy their squads  and quickly get out of the battle. No  battle counter is taken for leaving the  table. TANK RIDERS It was common practice for any  armoured vehicle to carry infantry,  because it beats walking! These are  referred to as tank riders (whether they  are actually on a tank or not).   They act just like other vehicle  passengers, but are far more exposed.  They can be targeted separately to  the vehicle, and thus can be pinned  separately, and count as in soft cover. If the transporting tank is hit by enemy  fire, then the tank riders are immediately  disembarked (they don’t hang around  with shells impacting around them).  They are marked as pinned. If the  vehicle they are riding is destroyed  by the hit, then D3 (a D6 divided by 2,  round fractions up) tank riders are also  killed and a morale test must be taken. OVERRUNNING DEPLOYED GUNS Given the size and weight of tanks, an effective way to destroy enemy guns is  simply to run over them! Any  tracked tank, assault gun or other  armoured fighting vehicle (this  does not include half tracks, or  tracked soft-skinned vehicles) can  attempt to overrun and damage/ crush a deployed enemy gun.  To do this, the tracked vehicle  is issued the Manoeuvre and Fire order, but the fire order is replaced by its  ‘Overrun’ attack. Of course, the targeted gun may use any Ambush Order to  get a last ditch shot, before it is rolled over, if the attacker is in its normal line  of sight. If the attacking tank reaches the gun, then the gun must make a Cover  save or be destroyed. Guns inside hardened defences, such as bunkers, or  deployed inside buildings, cannot be overrun.
