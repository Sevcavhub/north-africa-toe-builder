An infantryman takes the surrender

truck in the Western Desert,

2 June 1942. (4700-32 E 12810)

Those British Commonwealth troops making up Eighth Army, commanded
by Gen. Sir Neil Ritchie, were a mixture of tired veterans of the Desert War and
many inexperienced newcomers following the heavy losses of the months
before and transfer of units and formations to the Far East. They occupied an
inter-connected system of defensive boxes, each containing a single brigade
group, prepared for all-round defence and protected by extensive, deep
minefields and belts of barbed wire. Given the vulnerability of motor transport
in the open, few had their accompanying First Line transport with them
Behind them echeloned in depth were supporting armoured and motorized
formations. Large field maintenance centres packed full of fuel and supplies
were located throughout the rear areas in anticipation of a further advance.

protracted defence. Large gaps existed between defensive positions, through
which it was intended British armour would manoeuvre, and to the south a

a defences were by no means a continuous line

yawning 13-mile gap existed between Bir Hakeim and its northern neighbour.

Eighth Army had grown considerably in size. In May 1942 it consisted of
two corps — XXX Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Willoughby Norrie, and XIII
Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. W.H. Gott. The former contained most of the
armour, with the infantry in the latter. The Gazala line was held by XIII Corps,
with Ist South African Division deployed in the north from Gazala to Alem
Hamza. Two brigades of the newly arrived S0th (Northumbrian) Division
were immediately to the south of the Trigh Capuzzo. A third brigade - 150th

Infantry Brigade — was located to the south near Sidi Muftah, separated by five
miles of minefield. Each division had an army tank brigade in support, with
110 Matilda and 167 Valentine tanks in total. Further extensive minefields
continued southwards at the end of which was located Bir Hakeim held by the
Free French Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. M.P. Koenig, after which the
Gazala line ended hanging in the open desert. To the rear Tobruk was held by
the 2nd South African Division, although it was no longer such a formidable
fortress since many of its minefields and other defensive stores had been
stripped for use in the Gazala defences,

XXX Corps consisted of Ist Armoured Division and 7th Armoured Division
and was deployed to the rear of the Gazala line. It had 573 tanks — 257
Crusaders, 149 Stuarts and 167 new Grant medium tanks. This was a powerful
addition to British tank strength since its excellent armour and powerful main
armament effectively nullified any advantage the German up-armoured Mk Ill
Ausf. Hand even Mk III Ausf. J up-gunned tanks possessed. A further armoured
brigade was en route to the battle area with 145 more tanks. The Ist Free French
Brigade at Bir Hakeim came under Messervy’s command, as did three further
brigades in other defensive localities in its area at Retma (7th Motor Brigade),
Knightsbridge (201st Guards Brigade), Bir el Gubi (29th Indian Infantry
Brigade) and just south of Bir Hakeim held by 3rd Indian Motor Brigade.

Overall Eighth Army enjoyed a numerical superiority vis-a-vis Panzergruppe
Afrika in manpower, armour and artillery while the available air forces were
approximately equal in strength. It had 849 tanks against Rommel’s 560 (half
German), Eighth Army importantly also had Grant tanks, qualitatively far
superior to anything the Germans had to hand. The arrival of the first 6-pdr
anti-tank guns also gave Commonwealth troops a weapon capable of defeating
the frontal armour of German AFVs for the first time. The Eighth Army also
began the Gazala fighting, moreover, with an 8:5 superiority in artillery, but it
was widely dispersed throughout the frontline area.

The growing strength of Eighth Army convinced Rommel of the need to
strike hard and fast before his forces were outnumbered, using his mobile forces
to bring to battle and defeat the British armour. Axis intentions did not escape
the attention of intelligence officers. As news reached the HQ of Eighth Army
of an Axis build up in May, it was welcomed with some relief and it prepared
to meet the German advance on ground of its own choosing. The Panzergruppe
Afrika began its planned assault on the Gazala position in the late evening of
26 May, with a diversionary frontal attack launched in the north by Group
Cruewell (Italian infantry bolstered with German units), against South African
troops in the Gazala-Sid Mutftah area, intended to pin down the defenders.
This was where Eighth Army had expected its attack. Later that day under cover
of darkness the German armoured formations in the Afrika Korps, commanded
by Erwin Rommel, began a wide outflanking movement deep in the desert
to the south of Bir Hakeim, intended to bring to battle British armoured
formations and then cut off the bulk of Eighth Army occupying its defences to
the east. The Italian Ariete Division would deal with the Free French before
moving up in support.

This bold German offensive began well, with the DAK quickly sweeping past
Bir Hakeim as planned and then moving northwards towards Tobruk, Acroma
and El Adem, while Ariete attacked the beleaguered garrison. Initially, the
British reaction to this powerful armoured thrust was slow, lacked urgency and
was uncoordinated, with indecision and uncertainty gripping the British High
Command, in part due to poor relations between both corps commanders and
Ritchie, of whom they were highly critical. XXX Corps was thrown badly off
balance, A series of piecemeal attacks were launched on 27 May by the widely
dispersed armoured brigades as a result, which the Axis were able to defeat
in detail unit after unit, effectively squandering British superiority in tank
numbers and leaving the battlefield littered with burning AFVs. 3rd Indian

Motor Brigade was overwhelmed by 21st Panzer and the Italian Ariete Division,
the 7th Motor Brigade by the whole of 90th Light Division, 4th Armoured
Brigade by the whole of 15th Panzer Division, and lastly 22nd Armoured
Brigade by the 1Sth and 21st Panzer divisions. Similarly 7th Armoured Division
HQ was overrun, although Maj. Gen. Frank Messervy later made good his
escape by first disguising himself as an aged batman and then seizing an
opportunity to slip away. The Free French at Bir Hakeim, now astride the Axis
lines of communication, fought on despite heavy attacks by Italian troops.
Within 24 hours the German formations were deep behind the frontline astride
the British line of communications, throwing the British High Command
completely off balance, despite meeting stronger resistance than anticipated
and suffering significant losses of tanks largely at the hands of new US Grant
tanks. Bir Hachiem remained defiant while columns of British motorized
troops savaged his exposed lines of communication.

The Germans pressed their attacks towards Tobruk, despite ever more grave
shortages of fuel and ammunition as they were isolated from their supply
echelons; they were themselves under heavy British attack, back with the Italian
XX Corps at Bir el Hamat. On the 28th the DAK pushed past the Knightsbridge
Box, and 90th Light Division reached El Adem. A series of counter-attacks by
Ist Armoured Division on the DAK from the east, however, effectively checked
its advance. Despite the early German successes, the situation offered much
potential to the Fighth Army with Rommel’s spearheads effectively cut off from
his supply lines by the presence of a box occupied by 150th Infantry Brigade at
Dahar el Aslag; this was astride his proposed direct line of communication
through the minefield belt, something that German intelligence had completely
missed. Until it could be destroyed the German armoured forces, already
having lost 200 tanks, on 28-29 May concentrated in a defensive position in
a depression four miles by two miles, quickly dubbed the ‘Cauldron’, lying
between the Trigh Capuzzo and Trigh el Abd, with its back to the British
minefields. With great stoicism the hapless 150th Infantry Brigade, commanded
by Brig. C.W. Haydon, composed of Territorial Army battalions, endured the full

fury of the Luftwaffe, the DAK and the Trieste Division advancing through
the minefield for nearly 72 hours until sheer weight of enemy numbers and
shortages of ammunition told. On 1 June the box fell into German hands,
opening a supply line to the beleaguered armoured units in the Cauldron.

‘The British High Command had, however, failed to seize the glowing
opportunity that had presented itself of destroying the DAK in detail, while
it was effectively cut off by 150th Infantry Brigade. Indecision and uncertainty
reigned supreme at Eighth Army’s HQ. On 5 June the Eighth Army finally
launched a major counter-attack — Operation Aberdeen — intended to destroy the
DAK in detail. A series of poorly planned and executed attacks were launched,
however, without adequate infantry and artillery support, largely because the
armoured brigades had not been trained to work with infantry. A heavy price
was paid by armoured units for poor inter-arm co-operation, and yet again they
were decimated by skilfully handled German 50mm and 88mm anti-tank guns,
mines and carefully concerted counter-attacks by German armour. By the time
this ill-fated attack was over Eighth Army had lost another 200 tanks, four
artillery regiments and an infantry brigade. On the afternoon of 5 June the
rejuvenated DAK, now concentrated, confident and with a secure supply line,
attacked the much-reduced British formations opposing them, with 21st Panzer
Division smashing through the defences towards the Knightsbridge Box, while
15th Panzer Division swung round through Bir el Hamat in another outflanking
manoeuvre. Unable to offer effective resistance the demoralized Eighth Army
struggled to prevent the Gazala defences being overwhelmed. Following the
destruction of the British armour, the box at Bir Hakeim, moreover, felt the full

fury of the DAK seeking to clear its rear area. Following a desperate resistance
it fell, effectively marking the end of the Gazala battles, with 2,700 Free
Frenchmen breaking out on 10 June with the assistance of XXX Corps’ surviving
armour. Those German forces investing the box quickly moved north adding to
the weight of the main German attacks.

The British formations in the nearly intact XIII Corps, still occupying the
Gazala defences to the north, turned their flank 90 degrees along the Trigh
Capuzzo. Even though the British still enjoyed tank superiority it was ordered
to fall back, while the DAK advanced on El Adem and Acroma. On 12 June
the DAK inflicted a decisive defeat on British armoured forces near the
Knighstbridge Box, destroying 120 tanks. By the evening of the following day
the Germans had a 2:1 superiority in tanks and began turning their attention
towards Tobruk. The game was up for Eighth Army armoured forces, largely
destroyed; Ritchie grasped the nettle and ordered his still intact infantry and
logistical troops to withdraw. It was by no means an easy task. On 13/14 June
Ist South African Division successfully escaped entrapment and withdrew

eastwards. Similarly 69th Infantry Brigade (part of 50th Division) moved back
along the coast road towards Tobruk, but the 151st Infantry Brigade instead
advanced westwards into the Axis positions before swinging south of Bir
Hakeim and eastwards towards Egypt through the desert. Although it lost most
of its vehicles and heavy weapons en route, 90 per cent of its men reached
British lines unscathed.

Eighth Army yet again had been out-generalled and out-fought by the Axis
forces during three weeks of bitter battle. Following the failure of 4th Armoured
Brigade’s counter-attack on 17 June near Sidi Rezegh, it fell back in considerable
disorder towards the dubious safety of the Egyptian frontier. A far greater
disaster quickly followed the Gazala battles when the hitherto much-vaunted
fortress of Tobruk, together with 32,000 troops, mostly of 2nd South African
Division, and mountains of supplies, fell on 21 June within hours to a
lightning German assault. Its loss was a massive disaster for British arms and
cast a pall of gloom over Eighth Army. Little alternative remained other than
a further withdrawal. Eighth Army was harried back to the Egyptian frontier
having lost in total 50,000 men, and masses of tanks and equipment. By 23
June it had taken up a defensive line by Mersa Matruh closely pursued by the
Axis forces flushed with success. Two days later Auchinleck relieved Ritchie of
command and ordered a further withdrawal to positions at El Alamein closely
pursued by the DAK. Although few organized units remained, discipline and
morale still stood up well in Fighth Army.

The Battle of Gazala was a calamitous defeat for kighth Army that resulted in
heavy losses, the fall of Tobruk and a pell-mell retreat to El Alamein. The way to
Egypt and the Suez Canal and beyond now seem open to the Axis forces. The
battle had begun with the British stronger in terms of numbers and quality of
equipment, especially in the Grant tank, than their opponents. A poor defensive
layout had cost it dear. The battle had begun with British troops occupying
positions largely unsuitable for defence due to the planned offensive, and
throughout troops had been tied to protecting stockpiles of arms, ammunition
and equipment that would have supported an advance into Cyrenaica. The
German High Command, however, had shown superior generalship
throughout, with Rommel in particular exercising sure and sound control of his
forces. In comparison, Ritchie and the British high command had effectively
squandered the advantages with which it began the battle. A direct result of
poor communications and intelligence, divided foyalties and decision by
committee, and bickering between senior officers had played a key role in
preventing the GOC Eighth Army exercising effective command. A serious lack
of mutual trust and confidence was endemic in the command structure during
the Gazala battles, contributing to the piecemeal destruction of the superior
British armour and the failure to mass tanks and artillery at the decisive point.
In the final analysis, British Commonwealth troops had fought, moreover, less
well than during Operation Crusader. This prior experience had made many
veterans much warier than before in combat and a large influx of inexperienced
new blood in terms of replacements for casualties and new units and formations
had compounded the problem by further reducing combat effectiveness.

The Battle of Alam el Halfa, 31 August-
7 September 1942

The bruising battle of First El Alamein ended in July 1942 in a virtual stalemate,
leaving both British Commonwealth and Axis forces exhausted and badly in
need of rest and recuperation. A build up immediately began of fresh troops,
equipment and supplies on both sides, with the avowed intention of returning
to the lists once again. The Eighth Army, now commanded by Lt. Gen. Bernard
Law Montgomery, laid extensive, deep minefields and constructed further
elaborate field defences to prevent a renewed Axis attack into Egypt. In the

north 9th Australian Division held front-line positions anchored on the
Mediterranean coast and then in turn Ist South African Division and Sth Indian
Division down to the Ruiweisat Ridge (all belonging to XXX Corps). Behind
them 22nd Armoured Brigade lay in reserve. Further south XII Corps held the
line towards Himeimat, with 2nd New Zealand Division and 7th Armoured
Division in the line and 1st Armoured Division in immediate reserve.

The speed with which the British Eighth Army was thickening up its already
formidable defences in the north and his own deteriorating supply situation
convinced Erwin Rommel of the need to strike quickly (in what one historian
has termed ‘The Gambler's Last Throw’) in a mobile operation, which would
favour the DAK, rather than attempting a perilous breakthrough battle. With
the British growing stronger by the day, time was of the essence. By the end of
August the Germans fielded 200 tanks, with an additional 243 medium and
38 light Italian tanks. The former included 26 Mk IV specials (armed with long
75mm guns), 10 older Mk IVs, 71 Mk II] Ausf. J specials (with long 50mm guns)
and 93 of the older variant. An additional 29 light and 5 command tanks
completed the available force.

The German High Command selected the southern part of the front at El
Alamein as the site of a renewed offensive, using the tried and tested approach of
outflanking the British positions, since its defences were still weaker than those
in the north. A surprise night attack by the DAK, commanded by Gen. Walter
Nehring, exploiting the light of the full moon, was to be followed by a rapid
advance on a broad front 45km eastwards, brushing aside British resistance,
past the Alam el Halfa Ridge, the key to the El Alamein position, around Eighth
Ammy’s southern flank; it would then strike northwards into its rear towards
the coast near Ruiweisat Station. The northern flank of this advance would
be protected by the Italian XX Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Giuseppe de
Stephanis, and 90th Light Division, who would carry out shorter hooks into the
British defences conforming to the main attack. To the south a screen of German
and Italian reconnaissance units would provide security. The Italian XXI Corps,
commanded by Gen. Navarini, in the far north, meanwhile, would pin down the
Allied formations facing it by mounting diversionary raids. Ultimately it was
hoped Eighth Army would be trapped and cut off from its supply lines and its
motorized units forced to fight a mobile battle on German terms. The way to
Cairo would then be open for Rommel's armoured and motorized divisions,
while his German and Italian infantry formations mopped up around EL
Alamein. From the outset it was realised surprise, speed and sufficient supplies,
especially petrol, to wage a mobile battle were the keys to success.

‘The British High Command had already anticipated what Rommel had
planned, however, with ULTRA intelligence providing further confirmation,
and careful steps had already been taken by Eighth Army to counter it. The
Alam el Halfa Ridge had been heavily fortified under Auchinleck’s orders and
this was continued by Montgomery, who deployed two newly arrived brigades
of 44th Division along its length, backed by its artillery and anti-tank guns.
On the western end 22nd Armoured Brigade (part of 10th Armoured Division)
was also deployed, with the reinforced New Zealand Division holding a further
position at Alam Nayil to the west. KXX Corps’ reserve - 23rd Armoured
Brigade ~ was deployed just to the north and to the east was located 8th
Armoured Brigade around Point 87. The armoured units on and around the
Alam Halfa Ridge (mostly equipped with Grants) were to be dug in and used to
stiffen the anti-tank ground defences. The front line between Alam Nayil and
the Quattara Depression was held by elements of 7th Armoured Brigade, which
was to initially hold a German attack, but in the face of heavy pressure was to
withdraw intact to positions around Samaket Gaballa. 7th Division would then
carry out a mobile defence harrying the advancing German's flanks.

The German offensive finally began in the early hours of 31 August 1942,
with light provided by the full moon, having effectively already lost all element

of surprise on which it was largely based and despite worrying shortages of fuel.
A deeper than expected minefield belt, fierce resistance from British outposts
belonging to 7th Armoured Division and intense artillery fire, however, almost
immediately halted the advance while engineers gapped the obstacle. A series
‘of bombing raids and artillery fire inflicted serious casualties on the Germans
as they waited, including the commander of the DAK. The lead elements of
21st Panzer Division breached the obstacle at half-past four in the morning
after a renewed attack, but the vital elements of speed and surprise had been
completely lost and none of the first objectives were reached by morning.
As planned, elements of 7th Armoured Division fought a successful delaying
action as the DAK advanced eastwards. Although a gloomy Rommel seriously
entertained thoughts of completely abandoning the attack during the early
hours of the 31st, he instead ordered a reduction in the depth of the thrust
since both flanks were threatened by alerted British formations. Instead, Alam
el Halfa was selected as the DAK’s immediate objective since it could no longer
be easily bypassed. While the Italians struggled to penetrate the minefields,
shielded by a dust storm, DAK made further albeit very slow progress eastwards
on 31 August, but spirited opposition, air attacks and the need to re-supply
made progress slow. The Italian XX Corps and 90th Light Division made even
slower progress on the left flank, being delayed by fierce resistance, minefields
and difficult terrain,

The headquarters of Eighth Army had much to be happy with, with the
Germans having attacked where expected and already having suffered serious
loss and delay. The Italian XXI Corps and 90th Light Division were still
embroiled in the minefields. The direction in which the identified DAK was
heading was now known and was exactly as Montgomery had anticipated.
The British defenders on the heavily fortified ridge stood-to on 31 August
awaiting sight of the advancing German armour, with 22nd Armoured Brigade
around Point 102, west of Alam el Halfa, expecting contact all day. 23rd
Armoured Brigade, moreover, was ordered forward to fill the gap between the
