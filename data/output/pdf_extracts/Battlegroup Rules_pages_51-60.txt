BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Autocannons:  Area Fire with small arms  or HE, Aimed Fire with small arms,  Aimed Fire with armour piercing shells. Rockets:  Area Fire with high explosive.  Aimed Fire with high-explosive shells.  Bombs:  Indirect Artillery Fire. AIRCRAFT WEAPONRY Machine Guns  Most aircraft are armed with machine  guns. Each aircraft mounted machine  gun has a Rate of Fire of 3. So, an aircraft  with three machine guns would have a  total RoF of 9. Although armed with lots  of machine guns, they don’t carry much  ammunition. An aircraft can only fire its  machine guns three times per game, after  which it is out of ammunition and they  cannot be used again.  Autocannons Many aircraft are armed with  autocannons. These are fired exactly like  other vehicle mounted autocannons.  An autocannon mounted on an aircraft  has the additional advantage of the  aircraft’s own speed, meaning that the  rounds travel at higher velocity than  ground mounted weapons. Aircraft  mounted autocannons gain a +2 bonus  to their penetration value when used  against ground targets. They always  attack a target’s rear (top) armour value.  Autocannons also have three shots per  game.   Rockets The Russian IL-2 Sturmovik, British  Typhoon and American P-47 were armed  with ground attack rockets. All rockets  can only be fired in pairs, but multiple  pairs can be fired in the same attack.  Rockets are highly inaccurate, and  always hit on a 6, regardless of range  and modifiers. A rocket has an armour  penetration value as for guns, and  always attacks a vehicle’s rear (actually  top) armour value. They also have an  HE rating for Area Fire. Bombs Bombs come in three general sizes.  Small, medium and large, but even  a small bomb is still a rather large  explosion!  Each bomb has a  penetration  value and HE rating just like an artillery  shell. Bombs are dropped using the Indirect  Artillery Fire rules. Instead of any  Artillery Spotter placing the target  marker, a Forward Air Observer must  do it, using the Request Artillery Fire  order and then, instead of Fire for Effect,  giving the aircraft the Manoeuvre and  Fire order.  If the target point is not within the line  of sight of a Forward Air Observer, or  one is not present, then the aircraft crew  Bomb   HE   Size   Penetration   HE   Rating Small   Medium   9   7/3+ Medium   Heavy   12   9/2+ Large   Heavy   15   11/2+ UNIT MORALE TABLE D6   Roll   Infantry   Gun   Vehicle   Aircraft   1   Pinned/Rout-Surrender   Abandoned   Abandoned 1   Return   to   Base     2   Pinned/Rout-Surrender   Abandoned   Pinned   OK   3   Pinned 2   Pinned 2   OK   OK   4   OK   OK   OK   OK   5   OK   OK   OK   OK   6   OK 3   OK 3   OK 3   OK 3   Notes 1    Only abandoned if the vehicle is already pinned, immobilised, a soft-skinned  vehicle, or the vehicle has enemy infantry within 10 "  and no friendly infantry  within 10 "  i.e. in close support). Otherwise treat as Pinned. 2    Veteran and Elite Infantry units treat this Pinned result as an OK result.   3   As well as passing the Morale test, the unit is inspired to get into the action. The  unit may immediately attempt a ‘Beyond the Call of Duty’ test.          Sometimes,   in   the   heat   of   battle,   brave   individuals   or   well-led   units   do   things   that   are   above   and   beyond   the   call   of   duty,   heroic   deeds   which   gain   them   promotions   and   prestigious   medals.   A   very   good   Morale   roll   means   a   ‘Beyond   the   Call   of   Duty’   test   can   be   attempted.   First,   the   unit   must   roll   to   see   if   it   will   attempt   it.   Roll   a   D6   and   compare   it   to   the   unit’s   experience   level.   Unless   otherwise   stated   in   the   army   lists,   all   units   have   the   default   morale   level   of   Regular.   Inexperienced   unit:     4+ Regular   unit:       3+ Veteran   unit:       2+ Elite   unit:       2+         If   the   test   is   passed,   the   unit   can   instantly   be   given   a   free   Order,   which   occurs   out   of   the   usual   game   sequence.   Then,   immediately   resolve   that   Order.   If   the   unit   taking   the   test   is   already   Pinned,   then   instantly   remove   the   Pinning   marker,   and   then   issue   the   special   Order.   The   unit   has   suddenly   galvanised   itself   into   action,   or   its officer or NCO has suddenly  inspired   the   men   to   do   something   –   now!   If   the   unit   has   not   already   had   an   Order   this   turn,   a   Beyond   the   Call   of   Duty   order   does   not   count   as   its   Order,   and   it   may   still   receive   another   order   (therefore   gaining   two   Orders   this   turn   –   what   heroes!).  ‘B E y ON d  T h E  C ALL   O f  dUT y’ T E s T s 50

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES must spot for themselves. In this case,  roll for accuracy as normal, but add an  extra D6 to the deviation distance (so  an accurate result would be 2D6 instead  of 1D6).  Other Bombs These are dropped using the same rules  as above, but have different effects once  they hit the ground. Cluster Bombs Sometimes used for ground attacks by  FW-190s, cluster bombs dropped small  anti-personnel bomblets, each only  2kg in weight. Highly effective against  infantry, they lacked the explosive power  to destroy many armoured vehicles. A  cluster bomb has an HE Effect of 10/5+,  but count as Heavy HE when rolling  for Pinning. They have an Armour  Penetration value of 2 and always attack  a vehicle’s rear (actually top) armour.  PTAB Bombs PTAB bombs were an early Russian  attempt to develop cluster bomb  munitions. Each was a 2.5kg hollow- nosed bomblet and 192 could be carried  by a Sturmovik ground attack aircraft.  Dropped from just 200 metres, they  scattered over a wide area. A PTAB  bomb has an HE Effect of 6/5+, but  counts as Medium HE when rolling  for pinning. They have a penetration  value of 6 when rolling for armour  penetration, and always attack a  vehicle’s rear (actually top) armour. DIVE BOMBERS Both the German JU-87D and the Soviet  PE-2 were dive bombers, attacking from  a steep dive. This type of attack meant  that the bombs could be more accurately  aimed than with conventional ‘level’  bombing. When dropping bombs, a dive  bomber may re-roll one of its Artillery  Accuracy dice. The player may choose  which dice to re-roll, but must abide by  the second result. AERIAL OBSERVATION AIRCRAFT Some aircraft were used as spotter  planes for Artillery Observers. These  aircraft can use the Request Artillery Fire  order as well as moving, so the aircraft  can make a normal move (anywhere on  the table) and still spot for artillery in  the same order. Air Artillery Observers  use the same indirect fire sequence as  ground-based observers. AIRCRAFT AND    BATTLE RATING Being under air attack has a  demoralizing affect on ground troops,  and because of this, the first time any  unit in a battlegroup comes under attack  from an aircraft, regardless of the results  of that attack, the battle-group must take  a battle counter.  Conversely, shooting down an aircraft is  a big morale boost and a very obvious  victory. If an aircraft is destroyed, then  two battle counters must be taken,  instead of the usual one for a destroyed  unit.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES A NTI- A IRCRAFT  F IRE W ith air attack a constant threat,  a battlegroup will need its own  anti-aircraft defences. Anti-aircraft fire  is always resolved as Area Fire, as the  sky is literally filled with lead in front of  an aircraft, and always resolved at the  weapons maximum range, regardless  of where an aircraft model actually  is on the tabletop (remember it is  constantly moving anyway) and because  fast moving and evading aircraft are  notoriously hard to hit. Only anti- aircraft weapons, infantry small arms  and machine guns, and pintle mounted  vehicle MGs can fire at aircraft. AREA FIRE Aircraft are attacked using the standard  Area Fire rules, simply roll a D6 to see if  the aircraft is Pinned (this isn’t actually  Pinned as for ground troops, instead the  aircraft takes evasive action to avoid the  flak and climbs well out of harm’s way).   Multiple MG mounts Some anti-aircraft weapons with  multiple mounts increase their firepower  and damage. A multiple mounted MG  has its RoF increased to 10, and can roll  twice for Area Fire.  Multiple Autocannon mounts The most powerful anti-aircraft weapons  are multiple mounted autocannons.  These have their RoF increased to 10,  and can also roll twice for Area Fire,  counting as Very Light HE.  DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT If an aircraft is pinned by Area Fire, then  it does not roll a Cover save (there is no  cover in the sky!). Instead, roll another  D6. On a 4+ the aircraft is also damaged  and takes one hit, in addition to being  marked as Pinned. If the damage was  caused by a multiple mounted weapon  then the aircraft takes two hits instead  if one.  AIRCRAFT AND    UNIT MORALE An aircraft that takes any damage must  take a Unit Morale test, just as any other  vehicle that is hit but not destroyed. AIRCRAFT AND    BATTLE RATING If an aircraft is reduced to 0 hits, then it  is shot down over the battlefield. This  is a highly visible and welcome victory.  The commander whose aircraft is shot  down must take two Battle Counters  instead of the usual one, because of the  importance ground troops place on air  support and because the enemy get a  boost from seeing enemy aircraft go  down in flames. 52

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES B ATTLEFIELD   E NGINEERING A s well as getting stuck into the  hard work of destroying the  enemy, there are many other tasks  required on the battlefield by specially  trained Engineer units (also, pioneers or  sappers). Much of this work takes place  behind the lines, but the battlefields  of Kursk also required minefields to  be cleared, obstacles to be demolished  in the midst of battle, whilst damaged  vehicles needed repairing or recovering  and streams, gulleys, anti-tank ditches  and rivers needed bridging. These are  the engineer’s tasks (alongside fighting  the enemy – busy men!). MINE CLEARANCE The Russian defences at Kursk were  heavily sown with mines, and most tank  units had mine clearing pioneer units on  call to race forwards and quickly clear  the route of advance. Some tank units  were led by special remote-controlled  demolition tanks which, when  detonated, also detonated the mines.  To clear a minefield, an engineer unit  with a minesweeper, or a vehicle  equipped with a minesweeper or dozer  blade, must move to within 5" of the  minefield marker. It must then be given  the Engineering Order. At the end of the  Engineering order roll a D6. On a 4+ the  minefield is cleared, remove the marker  from play. On a 1-3 there is still work to  be done – you must repeat the process  and roll again. DEMOLITIONS Blowing things sky-high is one of  the Engineer’s principle tasks. A unit  with the Engineers special rule, that is  equipped with a demolition charge can  attempt to demolish a building, a  bunker, an obstacle, an immobilised  vehicle or up to 5" of linear cover  (like a wall or hedgerow). To set a demolition charge an  Engineer unit must move into  contact with the object it wishes to  destroy (building, bunker, etc). This  must a single, static target. The unit  must then be given the Engineering  order. At the end of the Engineering  order roll a D6. On a 2+, the charge is  set and ready to blow. On a 1, there is  still work needed – you must repeat the  process and roll again next turn.  In any turn after the charge is set it  can be detonated. Roll a D6. On a 2+,  the charge explodes. On a 1, there has  been a failure and the charge is a dud!  A demolition charge automatically  destroys a single target, for example a  bunker, a building (a small one, or part  of a larger one), up to 5" of obstacle,  an immobilised vehicle, etc. Remove it  from play. Any enemy units inside (or  using an obstacle as cover) take a 5/4+  high explosive hit, and are automatically  marked as Pinned for being caught up in  the blast and resulting collapse. German special engineering  vehicles, such as the Borgward  and Goliath, were armed with a  single large demolition charge. The  vehicle is given orders as part of  its command unit’s orders. Rather  than order the command unit itself,  the commander can instead choose to move a single vehicle by remote control.  First the command vehicle must pass a Communication check (2+). If it fails the  remote vehicle fails to act and the order is lost. If it passes, the remote vehicle  may make a normal move.  Once the move is complete, the commander can choose to detonate (or not). Any  unit, defence, minefield marker or building the remote vehicle is in contact with  is automatically hit. The explosion has an HE rating of 10/2+ and an Armour  Penetration value of 13. Any minefield markers within 5" of the exploding  vehicle model are removed from play, as is the vehicle itself. Once detonated,  a remote controlled vehicle cannot be repaired! If you have a model of a crater,  place it where the vehicle once was.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES   BRIDGING Units with the Bridging special rule can  build a bridge across a stream, marsh,  anti-tank ditch or even a river. Light  bridging units can build up to 5" of  bridge (enough to cross a stream, gulley  or anti-tank ditch). A heavy bridging  unit can cross 5" of river per heavy truck  it contains. So a unit with three heavy  trucks has enough bridge building  material to cross a 15" river.  Each full turn spent using the  Engineering order allows an bridging  unit to build up to 2.5" of bridge. So, for  the unit above, to build a 15" bridge over  a river would take six turns using the  Engineering order. VEHICLE REPAIR Units with the Repair special rule can  attempt to fix destroyed or immobilised  vehicles. If a unit with the Vehicle Repair  special rule starts its turn in contact with  a damaged vehicle the unit may be given  the Repair order and attempt to fix it.  An immobilised vehicle becomes mobile  again on a dice roll of 4+.  A destroyed vehicle is fixed and  battleworthy again (and the crew  lurking nearby climb back aboard)  on a roll of 6. A Repair unit may only  make two attempts to fix a damaged  or destroyed vehicle; if both fail, then  the vehicle is damaged beyond the aid  of battlefield repairs and no further  attempts are allowed. VEHICLE RECOVERY Units with the Recovery special rule  can tow away a single destroyed or  immobilised vehicle. If a recovery  vehicle manages to tow a damaged  vehicle off the battlegroup’s own table  edge, then he may replace a randomly  drawn Battle Counter from his stack  back in the pot (his opponent should  choose the counter ‘blind’ –again, no  peaking allowed!).  Each recovery vehicle may only do this  once per game, because once it has left  the table, it can’t come back (and it’s  heading to the rear workshops anyway).   MINEFIELDS A constant threat on the battlefields of WWII,  to mark a minefield place a suitable marker  at its centre point. Any unit moving within  5" of the marker has a chance of setting off  a mine.  Roll a D6 for the unit; on a 3+ it has set off a  mine and takes a 5/5+ HE hit, with no Cover  saves allowed at all, regardless of unit type.  Against an armoured vehicle, the mine has  a penetration value equal to a D6 roll and  always attacks the vehicle’s rear (actually  underside) armour. 54

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES BATTLEGROUP •  KURSK Each vehicle has its own profile, giving details of its  movement, armour and armament, as follows; Off-Road:  the distance a vehicle can move on the table top  (in inches) for a normal move, whilst travelling off-road (or  partially on a road and off-road). Road:  the vehicle’s top speed, travelling flat out whilst it  stays on a road for its entire move. Special:  any special rules the vehicle has for movement,  such as extra mobility or being unreliable. The full rules can  be found in the Unit Special Rules section. Armour:  rated from A to O (with A as the best), each vehicle  has an armour rating for front, side and rear armour. These  are used for hits from the vehicle’s front quarter, left and  right quarter and rear quarter. It also notes if a vehicle is  Open-Topped. The vehicle’s side armour due to its  Schürzen  is given in brackets. Weapon:  the vehicle’s main armament and any secondary  weapons are listed here. The weapon’s full profile will be  given in the gun profiles section. Mount:  how the weapon is mounted, dictating its arc of fire.  Ammo:  the number of shots the weapon has for the  entire game. This is not a literal number, but represents  ‘burst’ of firing at the enemy, given that one shot rolled  for isn’t actually one shot fired. Before the start of a game,  ammunition must be allocated as either HE or AP. So, if a  vehicle has an ammunition capacity of 9, it could allocate  this as 4 HE and 5 AP, or 7 HE and 2 AP. This is entirely  up to the commanding player. Some guns only have one  ammunition type, so they automatically have just that! A  vehicle that runs out of a type of ammunition cannot fire it  again until it is re-supplied.  VEHICLE PROFILES As well as vehicles, all guns also have a profile. Ammunition:  the types of ammunition available for that  gun, usual HE (High Explosive) or AP (Armour Piercing).  Some guns only have one type. HE Effect:  the number of dice and the roll required to inflict  damage with the gun’s high explosive shell, used against  infantry and deployed guns. Expressed as 3/6+, this means  three dice needing 6+.  Armour Penetration Values:  each shell’s value, rated from  15 to 1 (with 15 as the best) when rolling to penetrate a  vehicle’s armour. For HE rounds this is a constant value,  because a shell’s blast doesn’t get smaller over range. For AP  shells the value reduces over range, as the shell’s velocity  naturally drops off. Some longer guns include a penetration  value for the 50-70 "  range band.

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK A TTACK  / C OUNTER- A TTACK SITUATION REPORT: An enemy attack has broken through  and is threatening to penetrate deeper  into your division’s rear echelons,  which may force a withdrawal of  troops currently engaged at the front.  Your battlegroup has been held  in reserve to counter just such an  eventuality. You must move fast to  intercept the enemy breakthrough  and halt it. Reconnaissance units  are already tracking the enemy’s  movements and will guide you. Both  sides are on the march, so you must  move directly into battle, there is little  time for preparation. Scenario Type:  Meeting Engagement  TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreed manner.  VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total Battle Rating must withdraw  and loses the battle. Their opponent  is the winner. DEPLOYMENT 1. Determine table corners. Both sides roll a D6 and add the  number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The player with the  highest total chooses which table  corner will be his deployment zone,  his opponent automatically gets the  opposite table corner.  2. Place Objectives Place four objectives on the table. The  side with the most scout units places  the first, then take it in turns. No  objective can be within 10" of another  objective or any table edge.   3. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 4. Deploy Reconnaissance Forces The players take turns to place all  units from their reconnaissance  support. These can be placed  anywhere in their half of the table,  but not within 10" of the table’s centre  line. The player with the most scout  units starts deploying first.  If one side has no scout units, then his  opponent may position his own scout  units anywhere on the table and they  may start on Ambush Fire.  5. First Turn Both players roll a D6 and add  the number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The side with the highest  total takes the first turn. On a tie, the  side with the most scout units wins. If  it is still a tie, then re-roll.  6. Main Force Arrival From turn 2 onwards D6* units are  placed on the player’s table edge,  within 20" of his table corner, as the  rest of his forces arrive on the table.  Continue this until all the forces are  on the tabletop.  * In Company-sized games roll 2D6.  In Battalion-sized games roll 3D6.  20 " 20 " 20 " 20 " 10 " 10 " 56

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK F LANKING  A TTACK SITUATION REPORT The vanguard of your battlegroup  has sighted the enemy, moving  forwards to engage you. You have  recalled your forward reconnaissance  units to assist in the coming battle,  and in the meantime you have been  holding back, waiting for these units  to arrive as a flanking force.  Now all is in place and there is no  further time to waste. Your vanguard  must begin clearing the route of  advance; the rest of the battlegroup is  closing up behind them fast. Scenario Type:  Meeting Engagement   TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreed manner.  VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total Battle Rating must withdraw  and loses the battle. Their opponent  is the winner. DEPLOYMENT 1. Initial Forces  Both sides determine their initial  forces. Both sides have D6 units  chosen from their battlegroup already  deployed on the table. This may  not  include any scout units, but  apart from this restriction, it can be  any units the commander wishes.  All the other units will arrive as  reinforcements.   2. Place Objectives Place D3+2 objectives on the table.  The first objective must be the exact  centre of the table. After this, the  players take turns to place objectives,  starting with the player with the most  scout units. These objectives cannot  be within 10" of each other or any  table edge.   3. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 4. Determine Deployment Zones There are two deployment zones,  each 20" from a table corner. One  player should be allocated a random  table corner, with his opponent  automatically getting the opposite  corner.  5. Determine Flanking Zone Both players roll a D6 and add  the number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The one with the highest  total may choose which of the other  corners (not being deployed on  by either side) will be his flanking  deployment zone. His opponent  then automatically gets the opposite  corner as his flanking deployment  zone.  7. Deploy Scouts All the battlegroup’s scout units (if  any) must start the game deployed in  the flanking deployment zone, up to  20" from their table corner.  8.  First Turn Both players roll a D6 and add  the number of scout units in their  battlegroup. The side with the highest  total takes the first turn. On a tie, the  side with the most scout units wins. If  it is still a tie, then re-roll.  9. Reinforcement arrival From turn 2 onwards D6* units are  placed on the player’s table edge, up  to 20" from their main deployment  zone corner, as the rest of his  battlegroup’s forces arrive on the  table. Continue this process until all  the forces are on the tabletop.  * In Company-sized games roll 2D6.  In Battalion-sized games roll 3D6.  20 " 20 " 20 " 20 " 57

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK D EFENCE  L INE SITUATION REPORT Your battlegroup’s objective is to  advance and smash through an  enemy defence line. First you must  probe the defences to find the weak  spot, then unleash the full force  of your battlegroup to destroy the  enemy and advance deeper into  enemy lines.  The enemy lines have already been  under heavy artillery fire, and as such  will already be weakened. But it is  likely that reinforcements will have  been dispatched to plug any gap, so  be aware that, should you penetrate  the lines, a counter-attack will be  closing in – destroy it.  Scenario Type:  Attack/Defence TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreed manner.  VICTORY The first battlegroup to exceed its  total Battle Rating must withdraw  and loses the battle. Their opponent  is the winner. DEPLOYMENT 1. Determine Table Edges The defender may choose which of  the short table edges the Attacker  must deploy on. He gets the opposite  table edge. 2. Determine the Attacker’s Probing  Force and Main Force Probing Force The probing force must include all  the Attacker’s reconnaissance units.  These will be the first to test the  enemy defences.  It can also include  up to three additional units. These  can be any units the attacker wishes.  Main Force The rest of the attacker’s  battlegroup are his main force.  These begin to arrive from turn 3  onwards, on his table edge. D6*  units arrive at the beginning of  each of the attacker’s subsequent  turns, until they are all on the table.  3. Determine Initial Defenders All the defender’s defences must  be placed in the front line zone; this  is the central third of the table, as  shown on the map. In addition to the  defences, the defender can also place  2D6 units in the front line zone. These  can be any units from his battlegroup  that the commander wishes.  4. Defender’s Reinforcements Any units not deployed in the front  line zone are his reinforcements.  From turn 5 onwards D6* units will  automatically arrive on his table  edge, until all the units are on the  tabletop.  5. Defender Places Objectives Place three objectives on the table.  The defender places two objectives in  the front line zone, and one anywhere  else on the table, but not with 10" of  a table edge or any other objective.    The defender cannot claim an all  objectives secured victory.  6. Weather Conditions Roll a D6. On a roll of 1 there is a  sudden thunderstorm, grounding  all air cover. Any aircraft counters  drawn from the pot automatically fail  to arrive. The counters are treated as  1s instead. 7. Deploy Initial Defenders Place all the initial defenders  anywhere in the front line zone. D3  units may start the game issued with  the Ambush Fire order. 8. Deploy Attacker’s Probing Force The attacker’s probing force units are  placed within 10" of the attacker’s  table edge. 9. Resolve Bombardment A D3 of the defender’s deployed  units are marked as Pinned, due  to the preparatory bombardment.  Allocate the Pinned markers  randomly. 10. First Turn The attacker takes the first turn. Front Line Zone Third of table 10 " * In Company-sized games roll 2D6. In  Battalion-sized games roll 3D6.  58

BATTLEGROUP •  RULES Battlegroup  •  KURSK H IGH   G  ROUND SITUATION REPORT Your battlegroup’s objective is to  clear and capture high ground along  the division’s route of advance. It  will be well defended, and expect  minefields, but in order for the rest  of the division to press its attacks, it  is vital that any threat from the high  ground is quickly neutralised. The  enemy will fight hard to hold their  positions, and aerial reconnaissance  indicates they have reserves ready to  counter-attack.  To deal with the waiting enemy,  your attack will be unleashed in two  waves. The first wave should draw  the enemy’s fire and force them to  commit their reinforcements. The  second wave should move to engage  and destroy those reinforcements and  push-on to overrun the objectives. Scenario Type:  Attack/Defence TERRAIN Set up the terrain in any mutually  agreedmanner. Place a hill  somewhere in the defender’s half of  the table.
