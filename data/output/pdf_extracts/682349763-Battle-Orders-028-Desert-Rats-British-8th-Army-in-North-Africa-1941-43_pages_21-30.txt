Establishment and replaced by a Lorried Infantry Brigade. A further casualty of
this reorganization was the Support Group, whose two battalions of infantry
and other supporting arms had been found insufficient; it was disbanded once
and for all. Each armoured division now consisted of an armoured brigade
group and one motor brigade group, in accordance with the belief that
permanently grouping the various arms together would improve co-operation
between them. Henceforward each division contained three armoured
regiments and four infantry battalions.

The Armoured Brigade Group in an armoured division contained three tank
regiments, a single new motor infantry battalion and an affiliated artillery
regiment, equipped with both field and anti-tank guns. It was also allocated a
proportion of light anti-aircraft, engineer, and administrative units sufficient
for its needs. It formed the main striking force of an armoured division,
although considerable uncertainty remained over how to use the infantry
effectively, especially in the attack. A Lorried Infantry Brigade Group was
organized with three Lorried Infantry Battalions and a regiment of field and
AT guns, in addition to light AA, engineers and administrative units.

The organization of several types of subordinate units within armoured
divisions underwent alteration to fit them for their new tactical role, as well as
the availability of new and far more effective equipment.

The tank regiments in armoured divisions in Eighth Army also underwent
some reorganization consequent upon the arrival of newer and more powerful
tanks from the USA. Despite the obvious tactical and administrative advantages
of equipping a regiment with just one type of AFV, the slow arrival of sufficient
Grant tanks, and the psychological and tactical advantage of issuing such better
armoured, better gunned and far more reliable tanks, it was decided to issue
every regiment some of these AFVs. Some regiments were equipped with two
squadrons of Grants and one of Stuarts, while others had two squadrons of
Crusaders and one of Grants. Ultimately it meant some armoured brigades would
have regiments with just US tanks and others a mixture of Crusaders and Grants.

The Motor Infantry Battalion included in an Armoured Brigade Group
was largely a new departure. It consisted of three motor companies and one
anti-tank company equipped with 16 new and far more lethal 6-pdr anti-tank
guns. Each Motor Company had a reconnaissance platoon mounted in Bren
carriers, which gave it the capability of operating decentralized from the
parent battalion attached to an armoured regiment. Each fighting section in
a motor battalion had its own truck to carry it, along with its weapons and
basic administrative equipment. Since this allotment of transport matched the
units’ tactical organization motor battalions were often described as ‘tactically

mounted.’ Although some trucks had armour-proofing against small arms, they
were not fighting vehicles and had had limited off-road mobility. The main
function of the Motor Infantry Battalion was to restore mobility to tank units
by mounting an attack to clear the way through obstacles or destroy anti-tank
defences when the former met resistance beyond their capability to handle
it unaided. Other tasks allocated to them included mopping up, holding
objectives captured by tanks and defending localities as pivots for armoured
operations. None of these tasks involved intimate infantry-tank co-operation,
despite the fact that Motor Infantry Battalions might have provided
considerable support with their lavish scale of anti-tanks guns.

The three infantry battalions forming part of Lorried Infantry Brigades were
organized identically to conventional infantry units, except they had their
own motor transport for all men, arms and equipment. They performed a role
similar to those given to Motor Battalions, which the Lorried Infantry were
to relieve to free an armoured brigade for future operations. In addition, they
provided protection to leaguers of an armoured brigade at night.

The experience gained during Operation Crusader convinced the British High
Command that armoured brigades needed far greater artillery fire support than
before, especially to overcome German anti-tank defences. As a result, a single
RHA artillery regiment, equipped with 25-pdrs, was permanently affiliated to
each brigade group. This was a major step forward in terms of building mutual
confidence and ensuring close tactical co-operation. In practice, however, it
quickly became clear that a single regiment could not produce a sufficient

volume of firepower on its own to suppress or destroy German anti-tank gun
screens since it was extremely difficult to locate and neutralize such small targets
with a bombardment. As a result the artillery was normally used to lay smoke,
and then tanks still rushed in to make their own attack.

‘The infantry divisions in Eighth Army had also displayed some of the same
problems during Operation Crusader and its aftermath. A particular difficulty
was the absence of organic anti-tank capability within infantry battalions,
which led to repeated frantic calls from their commanders for tank support
or the allocation of 25-pdrs from divisional artillery regiments and their
misemployment in a direct fire role to provide protection. As Michael
Carver has written: ‘The “Crusader” operation was fought to an unending
accompaniment of screams from one infantry division headquarters, or field
maintenance centre, after another for tanks to come and protect them against
the presence or threat of enemy tanks.’”

The War Establishments of Infantry Divisions in Eighth Army were also
reorganized on similar lines into three Brigade Groups, each containing a
permanent grouping of the three arms in an endeavour to improve
co-operation between them and therefore improve tactical flexibility and in
turn combat effectiveness. An infantry division henceforth consisted of three
infantry brigade groups, each of three infantry battalions. A regiment of field
and anti-tank guns and a proportion of light anti-aircraft guns, engineers and
administrative units were added to each brigade group on a permanent basis to.
bolster firepower and enable it to fight as a self-contained tactical unit.

These changes also made the reorganization of certain units within infantry
ions essential. A major defect revealed in standard marching during the
early days of the Desert War was the lack of an effective anti-tank capability.
ing on 0.5Sin. anti-tank rifles and anti-tank guns allocated from the
visional RA anti-tank regiment as and when required had proved insufficient.
Accordingly infantry battalions also underwent important changes during
the spring of 1942, with the intention of improving anti-tank capability and
improving mobility. A standard infantry battalion henceforth consisted of an
HQ company, three rifle companies and a support company, with the latter
including a mortar platoon, a Bren gun carrier platoon and its own anti-tank
platoon of 8 2-pdr anti-tank guns. Transport when required was still provided
by divisional RASC companies. The belated formation of anti-tank platoons at
last made infantry battalions ‘tank proof’ to a reasonable degree, especially after
6-pdrs were issued, remedying one of the major tactical problems in Fighth
Army. An indirect benefit was that it freed 25-pdrs from anti-tank defence, which
could now concentrate on providing indirect fire support in attack and defence.

The Royal Artillery Field regiments in infantry divisions also underwent
alteration in accordance with these changes. A regiment of horse or field
artillery now contained three batteries of 8 25-pdrs and one battery of 16 new
6-pdr anti-tank guns (the latter found from existing RA anti-tank regiments).

The Battle of Gazala and its aftermath

The setbacks experienced in the winter of 1941-42 in North Africa led to
further changes in the structure of Eighth Army, as a result of a combination of
losse: battle, the need to rest and reorganize formations and the despatch
of formations to other theatres of war.

The Eighth Army that occupied the defences of the Gazala Line and
prepared for an offensive was still organized into two army corps and
supporting army troops, although their character and composition had
changed considerably. 13th Corps still remained predominantly infantry and
30th Corps an armoured formation. A significant number of formations had
departed for other theatres of war, including the Australians, New Zealanders,
and 4th Indian Division now serving in Cyprus. The veteran 7th Armoured
Division and the hurriedly reconstituted 1st Armoured Division (after the
disasters of January) made up 30th Corps, in addition to 201st (Guards) Motor
Brigade, 3rd Indian Motor Brigade Group, 29th Indian Infantry Brigade and the
Ist Free French Brigade Group. 13th Corps consisted of 50th Infantry Division,
1st South African Division, 2nd South African Division, Ist Army Tank Brigade
and 9th Indian Infantry Brigade. A much higher proportion of the available
troops were from the United Kingdom than before. This included SOth
(Northumberland) Division and 1st Armoured Division, in addition to those

British troops in command positions, independent armoured formations and
in the supporting arms and services.

The Eighth Army’s constituent formations’ basic organization was much the
same as before in terms of War Establishments. Indeed, the various proposed
changes in the organization of formations and units outlined above had not
progressed far. The Gazala battles began before all these organizational changes
could be fully implemented. Neither armoured division had completely
changed over to the new organization. Ist Armoured Division, for example,
still fielded the two armoured brigades it had formed with in the UK. Some
progress had been made in the brigade group organization, but since only
112 6-pdrs had been issued many anti-tank batteries still only had 2-pdrs and
many infantry and motor battalions still lacked organic anti-tank guns. Many
artillery regiments also still remained the same. The three armoured brigades
were up to strength in tanks, although some regiments had barely received all
their Grants when battle was joined.

The fundamental changes in War Establishment underway during the
summer (and in turn fighting methods) could not have come at a worse time,
n Eighth Army reeling from the shock of battle and attempting to cobble
together a defensive line against the advancing Panzergruppe Afrika. As
Paddy Griffith has written: ‘A change of tactics in the middle of a battle can
sometimes be a salvation, but on this occasion the change was not properly

prepared, disseminated or understood. It added confusion to an already
confused situation and often remained a dead letter* Indeed, the new Brigade
Group organization adopted by the armoured divisions and infantry divisions
did not prove universally popular and criticism mounted, especially after
experience of using it in battle grew. To some officers the formation of Brigade
Groups seemed another manifestation of the tendency towards dispersion and
fragmentation that Eighth Army had displayed on frequent occasions before,
and virtually ignored the principle of concentration of force. It dissipated
fighting power and especially militated against the concentration of artillery,
which was now the most powerful arm at the disposal of British commanders.
The obvious downside of a Brigade Group organization was that all too often
small groups of armoured forces, employed in ‘penny-packets’, had been
defeated piecemeal by German Panzer divisions operating in compact masses
of all arms. When attacked Brigade Groups simply could not call down enough
supporting artillery firepower or mass sufficient anti-tank guns to prevent
being overrun and defeated in detail.

The Eighth Army’s HQ resorted to further tinkering with organization
during the summer of 1942 to help improve combat effectiveness, instead
of addressing fundamental changes in doctrine and fighting methods. The
tendency towards dispersion and fragmentation of British forces manifested
itself again as the Eighth Army struggled to halt Rommel’s onrush, Following
the withdrawal from Gazala, Ritchie revisited the idea of Jock Columns and
ordered the creation of mobile columns from his existing divisions, given the
battered state of the remaining armoured formations, to concentrate all the
available firepower. Since it was believed enemy tanks were much superior to
his few remaining own AFVs, these were built around the 25-pdr field gun
as the main offensive weapon. On 16 June he instructed infantry divisions
to split into two parts, with an advanced mobile element consisting of
regimental groups (or columns) of all arms and a rear or static element that
would occupy a sector of the Egyptian frontier defences. A regimental column
would consist of the HQ of a battalion or field regiment, a field battery, an
anti-tank battery, an anti-aircraft troop, and a battalion of infantry (less a
company), to provide local protection for the guns. They were to carry out
a roving role towards Tobruk. With Eighth Army under immense enemy
pressure, however, little progress was made in actually forming these columns,
On 22 June Ritchie issued fresh instructions for all infantry divisions to form
“brigade battle-groups’, in which his most powerful remaining teeth arm - the
artillery — would play the major role, with small detachments of other troops
just to protect them, Progress again, however, was limited in forming them.
All these changes had the unfortunate effect of weakening further and further
corps and divisions.

The assumption of command of Eighth Army on 25 June by Gen. Sir Claude
Auchinleck led to the adoption of a new policy of mounting a fluid defence.
He quickly endorsed his predecessors’ idea of reorganizing divisions into
forward and rearward portions and ordered the latter into the El Alamein
defences, The forward elements of 10th Corps, for example, consisting of 50th
and 10th Indian Division, were to consist of the divisional headquarters, one
brigade group and all the divisional artillery. Similarly Sth Indian Division
and 2nd New Zealand Division were reorganized, although Maj. Gen. Freyburg
strongly resisted this change, kept two brigades forward and exercised his
right of appeal to his home government. Auchinleck also proceeded with the
centralization of artillery at the highest practical level, more than ever before
in the Desert War, and employed in accordance with a single artillery plan.
Ist South African Division’s successful defence during First El Alamein in July
in large part resulted from the massing of its divisional artillery and medium
regiments as they became available.

The Eighth Army at El Alamein,
August-October 1942

The appointment of Gen, Alexander as Commander-in-Chief, Middle East and
Lt. Gen. Bernard Montgomery as GOC Eighth Army in August 1942 saw
an almost immediate end to the tinkering with organization of British and
Commonwealth formations that had characterized the period since Eighth
Army’s formation. A new policy on organization was laid down that remained
in force until the end of the Desert War. Montgomery quickly stamped on the
idea of Jock Columns and small battle groups. An edict almost immediately
went out that the division henceforward would be the tactical unit and fight
as a whole in future engagements with the Panzerarmee Afrika, with Corps
and Army Headquarters exercising a proper control of artillery and engineer
assets rather than being parcelled out to lower formations. This was
particularly important in the case of the artillery, enabling its firepower to be
quickly switched to and fro as the situation demanded. It finally marked the
end of Jock Columns and the disastrous Brigade Group experiment that had
cost Eighth Army dear.

concentration of force were firmly re-asserted again. Indeed, during the

autumn the armoured and infantry divisions finally completed reorganization
‘on the new War Establishments initially proposed early in 1942, although
they would be handled very differently in terms of tactics. Henceforward the
constituent brigades of divisions would fight coordinated battles in close
proximity, with the full weight of supporting arms and services brought to
bear as and when needed. Only for a temporary and particular purpose would
brigades be detached in practice from their parent formation. By October 1942
three types of division existed in Eighth Army: Armoured, of one armoured and
lorried infantry brigade; Mixed, of one armoured and two infantry brigades;
and Infantry, of three infantry brigades. Each type also had the appropriate
slice of divisional and administrative troops to fight a battle on its own. The
Mixed Division — effectively a halfway house between an armoured and an
infantry formation - was the only real departure in organization. It proved a
short-lived development, however, and was abolished the following year. Apart
from the two Fighting French and one Greek Infantry Brigade Groups, the
Brigade Group organization was abolished.

‘The Eighth Army by October 1942 had a very different composition from
when first formed, with at long last British divisions forming the majority of its
fighting strength. A large Commonwealth contingent remained, however, and
given its experience remained a key part of its fighting strength. Eighth Army
totalled some 230,000 men, with an order of battle of 11 divisions, of which
seven were British. These included Ist, 7th, 8th and 10th Armoured divisions,
44th (Home Counties) Division, 50th (Lowland) Division and Sst (Highland)
Division, as well as smaller brigade-sized formations. The Commonwealth
contingent included: 4th Indian Division, Sth Indian Division, 9th Australian
Division and the New Zealand Division. A far higher amount of supporting
arms and services also took the field, with growing numbers of medium artillery
regiments adding considerably to available firepower in both attack and
defence. In total over 900 field and medium pieces were ready for action
554 2-pdrs and 848 6-pdrs had been issued to the troops. The tank strength of
Fighth Army had also been vastly increased in terms of numbers ~ 1,029 ready
for action and 200 replacements in reserve - and quality, including large
numbers of Shermans and Crusader Mk Ills equipped with a 6-pdr gun.

Following the Battle of Alam Fl Halfa the Eighth Army underwent
considerable reorganization, specifically to fit it for the task of breaking through,
the deep belt of Axis fixed defences running from the Mediterranean coast to
the Quattara Depression. In October 1942 it consisted of three corps, which were
deliberately organized as flexibly as possible so that their composition could be
changed at the drop of a hat. XXX Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Sit Oliver
Leese, had five infantry divisions under command, in addition to 23rd Armoured
Brigade Group. The former included Sist Highland Division, 4th Indian
Division, 9th Australian Division, the New Zealand Division (including 9th
Armoured Brigade on strength) and Ist South African Division. XIII Corps,
commanded by Lt. Gen. B.G. Horrocks, was smaller and consisted of the veteran
7th Armoured Division, 50th Infantry Division and 44th Infantry Division. A
new reserve corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Herbert Lumsden, had also been
formed soon after Montgomery assumed command - X Corps ~ strong in
armoured formations, which he later referred to as his ‘corps de chasse’ capable
of taking on the Afrika Korps at its own game. It originally consisted of the New
Zealand Division, Ist Armoured Division, 8th Armoured Division and 10th
Armoured Division, but as the latter could not be given a Lorried Infantry Brigade
it was broken up. The New Zealand Division, moreover, was lent to XXX Corps
for the breakthrough operations. Although formations were chopped and
changed as the situation demanded for the rest of the Desert War, Eighth Army
retained this corps organization. Substantial support was available to Eighth
Army from the Desert Air Force, whose strength had been considerably increased.

Doctrine and training

Fighting methods during the early

Desert War

The British Army had begun the Desert War in June 1940 knowing surprisingly
little about waging highly mobile operations using mechanized forces under the
peculiar conditions imposed by the desert. Indeed, it appeared virtually a new
form of conflict carried out using predominantly tank and motorized formations
fought in an area where no one had previously believed large-scale military
operations possible. The basic source of written doctrine employed by all the
British Commonwealth armies - Field Service Regulations and the manuals for
each arm of service (as amended by various Military Training Pamphlets produced
by the Directorate of Military Training at the War Office since World War II began)
— contained next to nothing of specific guidance. Although FSR contained much
of general value about war fighting, this was often largely discounted by men
on the spot due to a pervasive distrust of written doctrine, the fact that doctrine
was not imposed from the top down by senior commanders, and that it was left
to commanding officers to interpret official sources. Tank warfare using highly
mobile AFVs was a new and virtually unknown quantity, with contending
theories abounding within the Royal Tank Corps about the correct organization
and employment of armour, especially in independent mobile operations. Recent
experience in France had yet to be fully digested and lessons learned. Perhaps
most seriously a pervasive idea quickly became established that the desert was a
unique combat environment and caused serious difficulties; this in part explains
why FSR were largely ignored. To many observers it appeared the tank and the
desert presented a whole new challenge in terms of devising a workmanlike
doctrine with which to both prepare troops for combat and to direct the fighting
itself. With little authoritative advice from senior officers, much was left to
commanders on the spot. As Michel Carver has accurately described: ‘In default
of experience, the army had to either to rely on theory or, as most commanders
did, on what they regarded as pragmatic common sense or even happy-go-lucky
intuition.’? The result was that techniques were gradually evolved and various
new methods perfected.
