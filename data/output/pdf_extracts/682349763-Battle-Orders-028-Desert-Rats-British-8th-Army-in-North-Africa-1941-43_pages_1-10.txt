Introduction

The Eighth Army was probably the single most famous military formation
raised by Great Britain and its Commonwealth during World War II. Formed
in September 1941 from veterans of Western Desert Force and newly arrived
troops, it went on to wage an extended hard-fought campaign against German
and Italian troops across the desert wastes of North Africa, with fierce fighting
taking place in Libya, Egypt, Tripolitania and finally the mountains and
plains of Tunisia. It was the only theatre where the British Army could take
the war to the Axis powers, whose armed forces were led by perhaps Nazi
Germany's most able and charismatic Panzer general. It was also, in many
respects, a campaign as much against a hot, dusty and unforgiving climate
and environment in which British Commonwealth troops lived, moved and
fought, as against the enemy

This Desert War waged by Eighth Army was decidedly an imperial war
effort carried out for much of the time without significant US support. The
polyglot composition of Eighth Army, composed of British and a range of other
Commonwealth troops - Australian, Indian, New Zealand and South African,
as well as smaller Free French and Polish contingents ~ in itself helped Eighth
Army build a distinctive identity. Only by the Second Battle of El Alamein
did British divisions make up the majority of Eighth Army, and even then a

======================================================================

======================================================================

considerable proportion remained from the Commonwealth. By the end of the
Desert War, Eighth Army had its own style, a slang peppered with Arabic terms,
a distinctive ethos, and a ‘lived-in‘ uniform adapted to the heat of the desert.
Eighth Army was thrown into battle immediately in November 1941 in
Cyrenaica and engaged in a seesaw war fought back and forth along the
Mediterranean littoral, under a succession of senior British commanders
(including Alan Cunningham, Neil Ritchie, Claude Auchinleck and Bernard
Montgomery), during which its fortunes waxed (with an initial hard-fought
victory during Operation Crusader) and waned (arguably reaching its nadir in
June 1942 with the fall of Tobruk). Eighth Army experienced a sharp learning
curve. Indeed, it initially displayed amateurism of the worst sort, suffered poor
leadership and experienced repeated abject defeats. Defeat, however, was
ultimately crowned with victory following the decisive battle of El Alamein.
Much had to be learnt by trial and error about command and control, fighting
methods, doctrine and training in the harsh school of experience. It was a
campaign unlike any other fought by a British Army, involving highly mobile
operations covering vast distances in which tanks played a central role. Indeed,
the war waged across the ‘great sand table’ (a device used by the military to
teach students tactics) as one former officer has described it, was the great
testing, learning and proving ground for the British Army during the early war
years, without which success in its later stages may have been far harder. By
its end Eighth Army had acquired a new professionalism that stood it in good
stead during the invasions of Sicily and Italy. ‘The Mediterranean theatre of war.

Axis forces in North Africa,
1941

The combined German and
italian troops making up the
‘Axis armies in North Africa

had already proved themselves
formidable adversaries during
1941.The German troops
serving in the all-mechanized
Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK),
commanded by the gifted
German Panzer General Erwin
Rommel, were arguably at the
peak of their professional skill
and had proved highly adept at
waging fast-moving armoured
warfare employing blitzkrieg
methods in the desert, and were
equipped with some of the best
‘tanks, anti-tank guns and artillery
available in the world. While
underrated by some following
the dramatic success of
Operation Compass in 1940-41,
the Italian troops, making up

the mainstay of the Axis forces
in Libya, were dangerous
‘opponents who could not to be
dismissed out of hand. While the
majority were still organized in
comparatively immobile, poorly
armed, badly led and ill-equipped
infantry divisions, the best
trained and equipped were
‘organized in armoured and
motorized divisions capable of
giving as good as they received.

Combat mission

The fundamental task or combat mission first assigned to Western Desert Force
and then its successor Eighth Army in September 1941 remained virtually
unchanged throughout the Desert War. For Middle East Command, from 2 July
commanded by Gen. Sir Claude Auchinleck, the defence of Egypt and the Suez
Canal, the vital maritime link between the United Kingdom and the far-flung
eastern part of the British Empire, was always of key strategic importance. A
purely defensive attitude, however, was anathema to the Prime Minister and
the British High Command, who placed successive Commanders-in-Chief under
intense, sustained pressure to mount offensive operations. Eighth Army,
commanded by Gen. Sir Alan Cunningham, was given an immediate task on
its formation, like its predecessor Western Desert Force, with relieving the
beleaguered garrison of Tobruk, establishing airfields in the ‘bulge’ of Cyrenaica
to provide air cover for convoys plying between Alexandria and Malta, and most
immediately of defeating the Axis forces operating along the Mediterranean
littoral. To do so a range of combat formations drawn from the British
Commonwealth armies — British, New Zealand, Indian and South African — were
placed at its disposal, including infantry and armour, as well as a range of
supporting arms and services. A smaller number of formations from other
countries under Axis occupation also formed part of Eighth Army from time to
time, including the Polish Carpathian Brigade, Free French troops and Greeks.
The task of carrying out this combat mission assigned to Fighth Army —
indeed the whole character of the Desert War - was dominated and vastly
complicated by the sheer scale of the theatre of war, and by the difficult climate
and terrain across which for three long years it fought what was, in many
respects, a novel form of conflict. The backdrop of this extended fighting

between Eighth Army and the Axis powers stretched along the Mediterranean
littoral from Tunisia in the west, across Italian Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and
then into Egypt, ending at El Alamein. Tripoli and Cairo were separated, for
example, by a distance of 1,200 miles. Despite its size, the theatre of war was
largely free from human habitation, except for a few small towns and villages
scattered along the coast and tiny bands of Senussi nomads, who eked out a
bare living in the interior. In the west, the area around Tripoli was more highly
cultivated, as was that westwards into the mountains of Tripolitania. During
the endgame in Tunisia fighting took place in more open cultivated areas

The theatre of war
The area popularly and largely inaccurately known as the Western Desert (a
name correctly just applying to the area within the western confines of Egypt)
formed the main arena for fighting between the heterogeneous British forces
and the Axis powers. This was a rough rectangle some 240 miles long and at
the greatest 150 miles in width. It was divided into two distinct areas: the
coastal strip, and the desert proper lying above a line of steep escarpments.

The coastal strip (of varying width) lying between the escarpments and the
Mediterranean sea formed generally a low-lying plain, consisting of a limestone
pavement thinly overlaid with sand and scattered rock fragments, with areas
of open sand and sand dunes nearer the coast. Access to the sea was blocked
in places by salt marshes. Some rainfall meant the area supported limited
cultivation around which small settlements existed.

The twin escarpments, varying widely in height

and precipitousness, that separated the coastal strip
and the desert proper (lying on the limestone plateau
above) had particular tactical and operational
significance throughout the war in the desert. These
dominating natural features, rising to a height of
SOOft in places, faced northwards towards the sea and
provided valuable points of observation, and places of
concealment and were largely impassable to wheeled
and tracked vehicles, except at a few gaps. These
natural choke points - such as at Fuka, Halfaya and
Sidi Rezegh ~ provided vital access from one area to
another and because of this formed the focus of much
fighting during the Libyan campaign.

The desert terrain lying on the Libyan plateau
above the escarpments, standing on average SOOft
above sea level, was extremely flat with only a few
low-lying ridges and depressions breaking up a largely
monotonous landscape. The surface of the desert on
the limestone plateau varied widely from area to area,
presenting differing going for both tracked and
wheeled vehicles. The desert had relatively few
landmarks of significance and next to no vegetation,
except near oases deep in the interior. This made
desert navigation an essential skill for all combatants.
