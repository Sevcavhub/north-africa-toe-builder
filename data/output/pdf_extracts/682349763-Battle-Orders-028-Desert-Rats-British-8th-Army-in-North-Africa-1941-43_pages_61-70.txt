performance. Inadequate radio communications, particularly between higher
commanders, was a major factor which arose in the two ‘Msus stakes’ of 1941
and February 1942. The Eighth Army initially, due to pre-war economy, had too
few of the right kind of sets, too few trained operators, and security procedures
badly delayed the speed of transmission of vital information. More channels
were required for effective operational and administrative control in highly
mobile desert warfare and not enough sets were available to go round. Many
sets could only transmit Morse Code, lacked sufficient range and were too
cumbersome for mobile operations. With the exception of short-range sets
for tank-to-tank and intra-unit communications, wireless equipment lacked
range and was prone to interruption at night due to atmospheric conditions,
while ‘dead’ areas caused serious fading of transmissions. In particular,
pre-war medium-range sets proved quite unsuited to the desert. Although the
availability of trained personnel and the quality and quantity of radio sets
available gradually improved from 1940 to 1942, speech over a distance of
more than a few miles remained often indistinct, at night often impossible,
and was always insecure. A chronic shortage of radios, spare parts and charging
sets for those available, moreover, also badly undermined communication. Sets
on many British vehicles were found incompatible with those on US ones.
The infantry were in an even more parlous state with regard to radios than
armoured units, with widespread shortages of radios throughout 1941-42,
and those that were available were so bulky as to not be easily manhandled.
fo compound difficulties, during most of the Desert War skilled and highly
trained members of the Royal Signals were thin on the ground.

The downside of relying extensively on voice transmissions in Eighth Army,
however, was that it was the least secure means of passing on information,
and the capture of substitution codes by the Germans or else a failure to use
them meant radio traffic provided a fruitful source of vital information for
DAK intercept units. Indeed, a highly effective German intercept service meant
Axis Commanders often read British signals long before British commanders
received and acted upon them. It proved an uphill struggle for the Royal
Signals to impose strict radio discipline on the wayward combat arms. The use
of cipher instead of code words below corps level,
moreover, caused further intolerable lengthy delays in
the transmission of orders, which often arrived far too
ate as a result.

The Eighth Army had greatly benefitted from
mproved communications by the time of Second
\lamein, as wartime production kicked in and further
developments in signals technology occurred, The
availability in far greater numbers of good, reliable
radio sets sufficient for all the teeth arms dramatically
improved command and control. A combination of
experience and training meant skilled operators were
also freely available, while the Royal Signals had also
greatly expanded.

Intelligence

The availability of accurate, timely and reliable
intelligence to the British High Command played an
important role during the early Desert War against
the Italians, However, on balance intelligence did not
confer a decisive advantage on either side following
the deployment of German forces in North Africa and
the formation of Eighth Army, although it provided
valuable information about the enemy’s order of
battle, intentions and combat effectiveness.

The British High Command enjoyed the benefit of ULTRA decrypts during
the Desert War. In April 1941 the Enigma key for army-air cooperation was
broken, providing a fruitful source of intelligence, but this was not passed on
below GHQ Cairo. Far more useful information was provided post-September
1941 when German Army enigma cyphers were cracked. This source provided
key information about the supply situation, German air strengths and
occasionally battle plans. ULTRA was much less useful, however, when it
came to German battle planning, given the great fluidity of operations in the
Western Desert and was often outdated by the time it filtered slowly down to
the GOC Eighth Army.

The most timely and valuable source of intelligence about the conduct of
the land campaign in North Africa was provided by intercepted signal traffic
(less useful during quiet periods when use of RT was limited), patrolling by
armoured cars ranging deep across the desert, aerial reconnaissance, and POW
interrogations, and was on occasion a major force multiplier. However, until
January 1942 any advantage the British gained from reading German traffic
was cancelled out because Germans were reading British messages, largely
because of poor British wireless security, A range of Special Forces ~ the LRDG
in particular — operating deep behind enemy lines also provided a steady flow
of valuable information about the enemy order of battle and some information
about intentions.

Combat operations

Operation Crusader — Eighth Army’s debut

in battle

‘The British High Command in the Middle East had prudently resisted political
pressure during the late summer and autumn of 1941 for major offensive
operations in the Western Desert to relieve Tobruk until all preparations
were completed. Much work remained to be done following the acute
disappointments of operations Brevity in May 1941 and Battleaxe in June 1941,
in terms of carrying out a major reorganization and remedying serious
deficiencies in arms, equipment and training.

The rapid expansion of Commonwealth forces in the Western Desert to
carry out an offensive led to the formation of Eighth Army, commanded by
Lt. Gen. Sir Alan Cunningham, in September 1941. By November 1941 it
consisted of two army corps, in addition to the Tobruk garrison. XIII Corps,
led by Lt. Gen. Godwin-Austin, fielded two infantry divisions - 2nd New
Zealand Division and 4th Indian Division — with the Ist Army Tank Brigade
support (equipped with infantry tanks). The majority of fast-moving
cruiser tanks were concentrated in XXX Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen.
Willoughby Norrie, which consisted of the veteran 7th Armoured Division,
bolstered by the leading armoured brigade of 1st Armoured Division, and the
motorized Ist South African Division. 70th Division, 1st Polish Carpathian
Brigade and the 32nd Army Tank Brigade (equipped with Matilda infantry
tanks) composed the beleaguered Tobruk garrison. 2nd South African Division
remained in army reserve. A total of 724 tanks were available for the coming
offensive, with a further 500 in reserve. These consisted of various marks
of cruiser tanks, including new Crusaders, infantry tanks and newly arrived
US Stuarts, with 2-pdr or 37mm guns slightly superior in performance to
their opponents’ Mk IIIs. With 118,000 troops available, Eighth Army was

significantly stronger than its opponents, but it contained many new and
inexperienced troops in addition to the veterans of the Desert War.

The objective of Operation Crusader was to relieve Tobruk, recapture
Cyrenaica and open the way to clear the North African littoral. It involved an
advance by XIII Corps to attack and mask the Axis frontier defences at Sollum
and Halfaya, which the 2nd New Zealand Division, commanded by Maj. Gen.
Freyberg, would sidestep and then advance westwards to join its sister corps
near Tobruk. 4th Indian Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Frank Messervy,
would mop up the remaining Axis garrisons. XXX Corps would swing
southwards of the frontier defences, cross the frontier at Maddalena and then
advance northwards astride the Trigh el Abd towards Tobruk. 7th Armoured
Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. W.H. Gott, would lead the way, with three
armoured brigades under command. The rather nebulous objective of this
corps was to engage and ‘destroy the enemy tank forces’ after which it was to
relieve Tobruk. 7th Armoured Division would do so by advancing to Gabr Saleh
and then await a German reaction. At an opportune time the Tobruk garrison
would break through the Italian XXI Corps and link hands.

‘The opposing Axis forces in Cyrenaica, since 15 August 1941 organized as
Panzergruppe Afrika under General Rommel’s command, consisted of both
German and Italian troops. The Deutsches Afrika Korps, commanded by Gen.

Cruewell, consisted of 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer, and ‘Div ZBV’ (later renamed
90th Light) which was concentrated in north-west Cyrenaica undergoing
intensive training near Gambut. The Italian Savona Division, deployed in the
frontier defences along with smaller German detachments, was also under its
command. A group of heavy artillery batteries, known as Artillery Command
104, had also been recently organized for the attack on Tobruk. The Italian XX
Corps, composed of four immobile infantry divisions - Brescia, Pavia, Trento
and Bologna - stiffened by German troops, was investing Tobruk. The Italians’
20th Mobile Corps, led by Gambara, with the Ariete armoured and Trieste
motorized division under command, was nearby at Bir el Gubi and Bir
Hacheim, preventing a deep outflanking manoeuvre in the desert, but was not
under Rommel’s command. Both Panzer divisions had 179 tanks on strength,
excluding light tanks, while the Italians had 146 M13s in the Mobile Corps.
The British Fighth Army commenced Operation Crusader in strength never
before fielded by the British Army in North Africa. This offensive - the largest
armoured operation the British had ever conducted - initially met little
resistance when it began on 18/19 November 1941, thanks to strict security
precautions that completely fooled its opponents, who believed it was a
reconnaissance in force. Indeed, Rommel was completely surprised, since he
was focussed on capturing the fortress of Tobruk. A further advance was

ordered on 19th November to provoke a German reaction, resulting in the
dispersal of 7th Armoured Division’s three brigades to find the missing enemy
tanks, with 22nd Armoured Brigade heading towards Bir Gubi, 7th Armoured
Brigade towards Sidi Rezegh and 4th Armoured Brigade towards Gabr Seleh.
Ist South African Division moved up behind in support. 4th Armoured Brigade
lost heavily, however, when Battle Group Stephan (part of 21st Panzer)
counterattacked and was steadily ground down in strength by well-handled
enemy tanks and guns. 22nd Armoured Brigade did somewhat better near Bir
el Gubi when it attacked the Italian Ariete Division, inflicting losses on its
AFVs, but in doing also suffered a bloody nose. 7th Armoured Brigade reached
Sidi Rezegh within 10 miles of Tobruk, meanwhile, largely unopposed. By
the end of the day 7th Armoured Division was widely dispersed across the
battlefield, which was to have a baleful effect on later operations.

The DAK finally reacted to the British offensive on 19 November, albeit in a
confused and disorganized way. It quickly seized the initiative. Div. ZB was
ordered to recapture Sidi Rezegh, while the two concentrated Panzer divisions
dealt with British armour reported at Gabr Saleh and incorrectly identified at
Sidi Azeiz. 7th Armoured Brigade at Sidi Rezegh was reinforced on the 20th by
7th Support Group, in the belief that the road to Tobruk lay open. The 22nd
Armoured Brigade, however, after being relieved by Ist South African Brigade,
was ordered to support the 4th Armoured Brigade at Gabr Saleh, as intelligence
of advancing enemy armour reached Eighth Army's HQ. An encounter battle
took place between the 4th Armoured Brigade and 15th Panzer Division's
leading tanks, however, before it arrived.

The situation on 21st November still looked favourable to hth Army's
HQ, with a brigade and the support group of 7th Armoured Division at Sidi
Rezegh ready to attack and to link hands with a sortie from Tobruk. To assist
them Sth South African Brigade was ordered forward in support. Incorrectly
it appeared the two other armoured brigades near Gabr Saleh had inflicted
damage on the German tank forces opposing them. Orders were issued by
Gott for an attack on Tobruk, in concert with a breakout, and for the two
armoured brigades at Gabr Saleh to continue the battle against the German
armour on their front.

The Germans had at last realized the threat posed by British forces at Sidi
Rezegh, however, and both Panzer divisions were ordered to move north-west.
They successfully broke contact, leaving both British armoured brigades behind.
On 21 November, while Div. ZB and the Italian Bologna Division contained
fierce attacks from Tobruk and also from British troops at Sidi Rezegh, Cruewell
attacked Sidi Rezegh from the south-east, inflicting heavy losses on the
defenders holding the escarpments north and south of the airfield. Despite
the heavy fighting, both the 4th and 22nd Armoured brigades still failed to
intervene. By nightfall 7th Armoured Brigade had only about 15 tanks still
running and had suffered heavy infantry casualties fighting around the
escarpments to the north and south of the airfield. Scobie’s thrust from Tobruk,
moreover, had stalled. 5th South African Brigade on orders had also stopped
short of the airfield, given its inexperience and vulnerability to enemy tanks.

The developments at Sidi Rezegh on the 21st caused serious anxiety to
Cunningham and his staff, but misleading estimates of the relative strengths
of the opposing forces gave false hope. A similar false picture of what was going
on was shared by Rommel, who ordered Cruewell to form a defensive line
along the escarpments. The growing concentration of British forces south of
Sidi Rezegh, however, convinced both Rommel and Cruewell independently of
the need to act against it without delay, with 21st Panzer Division ordered to
make an attack from the western flank, and later that day 15th Panzer Division
from the eastern flank. Fierce fighting ensued as 7th Support Group’s infantry
were forced off the ridge and airfield by 21st Panzer Division, and 22nd
Armoured Brigade’s tanks failed to make an impact. 4th Armoured Brigade,

======================================================================
PAGE 67
======================================================================

moreover, failed to intervene. 1Sth Panzer Division attacked later that night
and added further chaos to the battlefield by attacking the HQ of 4th Armoured
Brigade and putting it out of contact with its superiors. By the end of the 22nd
the position appeared much less favourable to Eighth Army, whose armoured
formations had suffered heavy losses.

The Germans thought they had to make one last major effort on 22/23
November at Sidi Rezegh to win, believing enemy tank losses to have been severe,
by preparing a pincer movement. While 21st Panzer held Sidi Rezegh airfield,
Sth Panzer Division would move around Gott’s rear to join hands with Ariete
Division and then together both formations would drive northwards forcing
Gott’s surviving forces into the hands of German troops at Sidi Rezegh.

This manoeuvre was successfully carried out by 15th Panzer, which, after
successfully joining hands with Ariete, advanced northwards at 1500 hours on
23 November side by side. En route fierce fighting erupted as the supply
echelons of 7th Support Group were encountered and then Sth South African
Brigade was discovered near the southern end of the Sidi Rezegh escarpment.
This formation offered desperate resistance, but was quickly overrun and
taken into captivity. Although it had been a disastrous day for Eighth Army,
it cost Cruewell heavy tank losses - 72 out of his remaining 162 - as well as
crippling losses of many battalion and company officers, NCOs and men.

Only 90 of the 249 DAK tanks that began the fighting five days before were
runners. The remainder of the DAK was now badly disorganized and in need
of rest and reorganization.

‘The GOC Eighth Army had become deeply worried, anxious and depressed
about Operation Crusader as news of mounting tank losses and the fate of
Sth South African Brigade reached his HQ. Indeed, Cunningham gave serious
thought to withdrawing to Egypt as his earlier optimism vanished in a puff of
smoke. His undaunted CGS and both corps commanders, however, thought
otherwise. XIII Corps was in a far better condition and its progress gave the HQ
of Eighth Army some grounds for optimism. By 21 November it had outflanked
the frontier positions and 4th Indian Division began steadily mopping up
the defenders, while the 2nd New Zealand Division advanced as planned
westwards towards Tobruk along the coastal strip without meeting serious
opposition. This progress meant Cunningham tasked XIII Corps with joining
hands with Scobie, while XXX Corps guarded its flank and completed the
‘destruction of the remaining German armour’. To do so XIII Corps was
bolstered by Ist South African Division transferred from XXX Corps. It would
not, however, be carried out by Cunningham, whom the Commander-in-Chief
had found mentally and physically exhausted when he visited his HQ for
consultation. As further events unfurled Cunningham was relieved of his
command and placed on the sick list for not having ‘the mental resilience to
cope with the built-in crises of desert warfare’. In his stead Maj. Gen. Neil
Ritchie, Auchinleck’s Deputy Chief of Staff, was appointed GOC Eighth Army
on 26 November 1942

‘The Germans upset British plans for continuing the offensive and their
hopes that XXX Corps would have a brief respite while XIII Corps took the
lead. On 24 November the DAK and Ariete Division boldly attacked eastwards,
with Rommel at their head, from Sidi Rezegh down the Trigh el Abd towards
the frontier, believing Eighth Army to be already badly disrupted. This so-called
‘dash to the wire’ had the aim of encircling the 2nd New Zealand and 4th
Indian divisions between the DAK and Savona in the frontier defences. It
caught the British completely off-guard and smashed through the rear area of
XXX Corps scattering its supply echelons, but missing its dumped supplies. A
sense of acute alarm and despondency immediately spread, with no combat

units between the DAK and the airfields and supply depots on which Eighth
Army depended. The dash, however, had little lasting physical or moral effect,
with the German armour spending two largely fruitless days swanning around
both sides of the frontier defences. It suffered heavy losses from artillery and
air attack, moreover which caused the wide dispersion of remaining German
tanks before it withdrew westwards to refuel at Bardia. The presence of the
DAK had little effect on the advancing New Zealand brigades, supported by Ist
\rmy Tank Brigade, whose tough infantrymen pushed onwards towards Tobruk
against fierce resistance from Div. ZBV and Artillery Command 104. It did
not completely escape, however, German attention. On 27 November the HQ
of Sth New Zealand Brigade and one battalion was overrun near Sid Azeiz by
1th Panzer Division. The same day, however, 4th New Zealand Brigade made
contact with the Tobruk garrison.

The DAK, responding to calls for assistance from the rest of Panzergruppe
\frika against attacks by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the deteriorating
situation near Tobruk, finally withdrew along the Trigh Capuzzo from the
frontier area on 27 November. As it did so the reorganized 7th Armoured
Division struck back, for the first time with its armour concentrated. Heavy
losses were inflicted by 22nd Armoured Brigade and 4th Armoured Brigade
when it ambushed 15th Panzer Division, but when they withdrew at night to
leaguer the DAK escaped westwards to pose a potent threat to the rear of 2nd
New Zealand Division. As Carver notes: ‘For the sake of performing a nightly
ritual, therefore, the fruits of the first occasion on which the British armour had
een able to forestall the German, and concentrate against a portion of it, were
thrown away.'22

The DAK was now able to pose a significant threat to the advancing New
Zealanders near Tobruk, although this was not initially perceived by senior
British officers, who thought it was making good its escape. On 30 November 6th
New Zealand Brigade at Sidi Rezegh was virtually destroyed and the 2nd New
Zealand withdrew temporarily into the fortress, closing the corridor to Tobruk.

The writing was on the wall for Panzergruppe Afrika, however, with further
attempts by the Germans in the Sidi Rezegh area during the first week of

December to dislodge the British proving fruitless. Although further local
successes were achieved against the New Zealanders near the escarpments, the
combat strength of the DAK had been steadily ground down and its remaining
troops were physically and mentally exhausted. Less than half the original
tanks remained and two-thirds of the guns that had begun the battle
remained. A combination of attacks by the Royal Navy and RAF had made the
German logistical position all but unsupportable. While Eighth Army could
draw on substantial reserves of men, vehicles and tanks to make good its
own losses few were available to the Axis forces after its dumps in Cyrenaica
were exhausted. Rommel recognized the inevitable, that he could not help
the beleaguered frontier garrisons, isolate Tobruk and effectively oppose XXX
Corps. By 6 December his forces had withdrawn from areas north of Via
Balbia and Sidi Rezegh. On 7 December Rommel finally acknowledged defeat
and ordered a withdrawal towards Gazala and in turn El Agheila, with DAK
covering Panzergruppe Afrika, leaving the field of battle in Eighth Army's
victorious hands and abandoning the Axis frontier garrisons to their fate.
Unfortunately, the pursuit was not well managed and the Germans reached
Agedabia on Christmas Day.

The Eighth Army emerged victorious from Operation Crusader having
achieved a notable success, albeit after a bruising engagement that had tested
the mettle of its officers and men. It had achieved its objective of evicting
the Germans from Cyrenaica and relieving Tobruk. A taste of ‘muddle and
failure’ was left, however, in the mouths of many participants by this complex
and hard-fought battle that had ranged backwards and forwards across the
desert, Although Eighth Army did not achieve a decisive victory, Rommel lost
2,300 killed, 6,100 wounded and 29,000 prisoners, with 1,300 secured from
the abandoned frontier garrisons. In comparison, Eighth Army lost 17,700
casualties (15 per cent), 2,900 officers and men dead, 7,300 wounded, and
the rest prisoners. The Germans had appeared superior tactically throughout
Operation Crusader, although this was not due to technical superiority in tanks
as many then and later have claimed. A significant advantage was conferred on
the Germans, however, by the possession of superior anti-tank guns, artillery
and armoured personnel carriers. The Germans also displayed considerably
better skill at handling these weapons, especially 88mm and SOmm AT guns
that inflicted the great majority of British tank losses, in close cooperation
with other arms of service. The battle had some unfortunate effects, including
a serious loss of faith in the 2-pdr anti-tank gun, resulting in the misuse of 25-
pars in this role and constant demands from the infantry for tank protection.
The victory hid other problems with Eighth Army, including its command and
control, lack of co-operation between formations, poor combined-arms tactics,
the wide dispersal of artillery assets, and lastly the failure to concentrate
armoured formations at the decisive point.

The Battle of Gazala - Eighth Army on the
defensive, May-June 1942

The opportunist Axis counter-offensive that had begun in January 1942
culminated in the recapture of western Cyrenaica from a surprised and
bewildered Eighth Army. It finally ground to halt on 4 February 1942 in front
of a line of prepared defences stretching from Gazala on the Mediterranean
coast southwards to an isolated defensive position deep in the open desert
at Bir Hakeim, The so-called ‘Benghazi Stakes’ had shown once again the
strengths and limitations of Eighth Army and its Axis opponents. A lull ensued
between February and mid May 1942 as both sides rested, recovered and
regrouped following the previous high-tempo operations, with the British High
Command busily preparing Eighth Army for a renewed all-out offensive to
recapture vitally needed airfields in the bulge of Cyrenaica.
