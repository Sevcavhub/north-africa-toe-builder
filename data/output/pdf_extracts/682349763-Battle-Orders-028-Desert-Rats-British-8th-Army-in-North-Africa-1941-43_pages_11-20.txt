The desert environment
‘The Western Desert was a hostile
environment.A period of mental and
physical adjustment was necessary for
newcomers to accustom them to the
silence, immensity and loneliness of
living, moving and fighting across the
wide desert expanses. The climate

was variable. During daylight hours
unremitting intense heat posed a major
problem, especially to crews operating
within already baking hot, noisy and
airless vehicles, while sunstroke and
sunburn affected the unwary. At night

and particularly during the winter
months temperatures often plummeted.
Heavy rainfall during the winter was not
unknown, suddenly causing the barren
desert to flower, fash floods to run
down otherwise dry river courses.

summer hot fierce desert winds often

The main area of intensive combat operations
fought by Eighth Army was demarcated to the south
of the Western Desert by the oases of Jarabub and
Siwa, lying at the edge of the great sand sea, a tract
of deep sand and high dunes impassable to wheeled
or tracked vehicles, which stretched hundreds of
miles. To the south of the railway halt at El Alamein
in Egypt the Quattara Depression, a vast area of
salt marsh lying 200ft below sea level, passable only
to camels along a few tracks, created a natural
bottleneck some 40 miles wide.

The barren, unpopulated and wide open expanses
of the open desert gave unparalleled free scope for
manoeuvre for fast-moving armoured and motorized
units and meant mobility was always at a premium.
It often proved difficult to know where anybody
was at a given time and also very difficult to judge
distances in the desert, and engagements often took
place at long range. The desert also imposed massive

machinery and smothering foodstuffs.
Visibility fell to a minimum providing
useful concealment for the movement

Unit organization

Formation and early Eighth Army
organization

Eighth Army formally came into existence at midnight on 26 September 1941,
following the massive expansion of British forces in Egypt carried out under the
command of the newly appointed Gen. Sir Claude Auchinleck (who had held
the appointment of Commander-in-Chief, Middle East since July). Following
earlier disastrous defeats in Cyrenaica at the hands of the newly arrived
DAK, commanded by the formidable Gen. Erwin Rommel, and the failure of
Operations Brevity and Battleaxe, Western Desert Force, originally an under-
strength division and then an improvised corps, had been hurriedly reinforced
from nearly every part of the British Empire. It had also been rebuilt with large
quantities of eagerly awaited tanks, guns and vehicles on a scale unknown in
the Western Desert before.

The new Eighth Army, commanded by Lt. Gen. Sir Alan Cunningham
(fresh from a successful command in East Africa), had on its formation two
fully established army corps consisting of armoured and infantry divisions,
independent brigades and supporting arms and logistic troops. It was a
heterogenous force drawn from every corer of the far-flung British Empire.
While command of Eighth Army and its armoured units, medium and heavy
artillery, corps and support troops were British, the bulk of the divisions in
Eighth Army were initially Australian, New Zealand, South African and Indian.
A hard core for this new army was provided by the highly experienced
and desert-worthy former divisions of Western Desert Force ~ the veteran 7th
Armoured Division and 4th Indian Division.

under the command of Lt. Gen. A.R. Godwin-Austin. It was predominantly
an infantry formation and consisted of two infantry divisions - the 2nd New
Zealand Division and 4th Indian Division - with the Ist Army Tank Brigade
in support. Neither infantry division was motorized and they were dependent
upon the provision of 3-ton troop-carrying lorries for mobility. Like other
formations of the Indian Army, 4th Indian Division was not composed solely
of manpower from the subcontinent, containing a substantial contingent of
British troops. A new corps - later numbered 30th - was formed under Lt. Gen.
Vivian Pope (an acknowledged expert in armoured warfare), with the intention
of it being the main armoured and motorized striking force in Eighth Army. Its
HQ mobilized in Egypt at the beginning of October, with its staff officers drawn

unfortunate air accident near Cairo, however, killed its designated commander
and his principal staff officers, and in his place Maj. Gen. Willoughby Norrie,
formerly GOC Ist Armoured Division en route via the Cape, was appointed
corps commander. By 21 October this new higher formation HQ had moved
into the desert and began to operate. It consisted of the veteran 7th Armoured
Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. W.H. ‘Strafer’ Gott, and Ist South African
jon, commanded by Maj. Gen. Brink, and lastly 22nd Guards Brigade. Ist
South African Division was fully motorized, but it lacked a full complement of
vehicles. 2nd South African Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. LP. de Villiers,
remained in army reserve. A third Corps HQ ~ the 10th — was also formed in
August, but its officers were quickly robbed to form the new HQ of Eighth Army
and it was sent to the Levant to join 9th Army. In addition, the beleaguered
garrison of Tobruk, commanded by Maj. Gen. Scobie, was part of Eighth Army's
command. It consisted of the British 70th Division, the Ist Polish Carpathian
Brigade and the 32nd Army Tank Brigade.

Divisional and brigade organization

The organization of British higher formations in Eighth Army - brigades and
divisions - generally conformed with that of the rest of the British Army
throughout the Desert War, although local variations in War Establishments
were introduced meeting the requirements of this demanding theatre of
operations. This applied to all British and Commonwealth units and
formations, who, despite their varied country of origin, were deliberately
organized along identical lines in accordance with pre-war policy laid down
by the Imperial General Staff. This dictated that troops through the British
Empire should be organized, equipped and trained on standard lines, and
was deliberately intended to ensure that all could easily operate alongside
each other with the minimum tactical and administrative fuss. Although
strict War Establishments were laid down, it must be remembered that it
was always intended to be a flexible system with units added or taken away
from formations as the situation demanded. The 4th Armoured Brigade during
Operation Crusader, for example, was considerably augmented in strength.
Similarly 7th Armoured Division was very tank heavy in relation to the other
arms when it fought during Operation Crusader:

The deeply held belief in Britain amongst tank proponents before World
War II broke out (inspired by the visionary theories of Maj. Gen. J.F.C. Fuller and
Capt. Basil Liddell Hart) in the ascendancy of the tank and ‘pure’ armoured
warfare, was reflected in the way British armoured divisions (the most important
formations in Eighth Army given the nature of desert warfare) were organized
during the opening stages of war in North Africa. According to this view future
battles would be fought primarily between tanks alone, exploiting the shock
effect of mobility, manoeuvre and dispersion upon the enemy of mechanized
forces. The main function of an armoured division would be to seek out and
destroy enemy armoured formations unaided, employing manoeuvre and
mobility to the maximum effect. In such engagements tanks would always play
the predominant role with other arms occupying a very subordinate position.
Early experience in the Western Desert appeared to bear this out. As Gen.
Auchinleck informed Churchill soon after he assumed command:

It is quite clear to me that infantry divisions, however well trained and
equipped, are no good for offensive operations in this terrain against
enemy armoured forces. Infantry forces are and will be needed to hold
defended localities after enemy armoured forces have been neutralized
and destroyed, but the main offensive must be carried out by armoured
formations supported by motorized formations.!

The War Establishment of armoured divisions, equipped with various types of
fast-moving and lightly armoured cruiser tanks for maximum mobility, serving,
in the Middle East was extremely tank heavy as a result of the above pre-war
assumptions about the nature of armoured warfare. Indeed, this belief had been
reinforced by earlier successes in the Western Desert against the ill-equipped,
poorly led and extremely reticent Italian Army. An armoured division, in
accordance with its War Establishment, normally had two complete armoured
brigades, each having three armoured regiments with a grand total of 330
AFVs. All the other supporting arms were concentrated in a Support Group.
This, however, consisted of just two regiments of field artillery equipped
with 25-pdrs, a single Royal Artillery anti-tank regiment equipped with 2-pdrs,
an anti-aircraft battery equipped mostly with 40mm Bofors light anti-aircraft
guns, and just two motorized infantry battalions. A Support Group was
normally handled as a separate manoeuvre element in battle, although in
practice some of these assets were parceled out to the armoured brigades for

operations. During Operation Crusader 7th Armoured Brigade, for example,
went into battle with a single infantry company, 16 25-pdrs, and a troop of AT
and LAA guns attached. This very low provision of other arms reflected the
prevalent idea that tanks would always shoulder the burden of the fighting,
leaving the remainder of the formation far to the rear — which would only
come forward to shoulder defensive duties such as protecting nightly leaguers.

The organization of independent Army Tank Brigades, equipped with
heavily armoured and slow-moving infantry tanks that had a very limited
radius of action, mirrored in some ways those equipped with lighter and faster
cruiser tanks, although they were organized, equipped and trained for a very
different role. Each Army Tank Brigade consisted of a Brigade Headquarters
and three tank regiments, but lacked any supporting arms since they were only
ever employed in direct support of other formations. A complete Army Tank
Brigade was normally allocated to an infantry division for offensive operations,
for example, with one regiment attached per brigade. In practice, constant
demands from infantry commanders during the Desert War for protection from
enemy armour meant infantry tanks often remained with infantry formations
for long periods of time. A close relationship frequently developed as a result
with each of the two arms, considerably enhancing the ability of the other to
take its place on the battlefield. This close relationship meant co-operation
between infantry tanks and infantry generally worked well during the Desert
War. Indeed, a good infantry brigade accustomed to working with a good unit
of the Royal Tank Regiment was in many ways the equivalent of a full-blown
armoured Brigade Group.

The infantry divisions serving in Eighth Army arguably underwent the
least organizational changes during the Desert War, although considerable
uncertainty, as already noted, always existed over just how the infantry was to
be used in the attack and in turn how it should be organized and equipped.
For much of the Desert War its main function remained the defense of fixed
positions in the desert and assaults against enemy prepared positions backed by
the full panoply of other supporting arms and services.

All the British and Commonwealth infantry divisions that fought in the
Western Desert were organized into three infantry brigades, each having
three infantry battalions. Each standard British infantry battalion during the
early years of the war in North Africa consisted of a Headquarters Company,
containing a Signal, Anti-Aircraft, Mortar, Carrier (equipped with Bren or
Universal tracked carriers), Pioneer and Administrative platoons, and four Rifle
companies that marched on foot. When motor transport was required it was
provided from a central pool provided by divisional RASC companies. The only
anti-tank capability within infantry units was provided by mines, sticky bombs
and the largely ineffective 0.5Sin. Boyes anti-tank rifle, which in practice was
supplemented whenever possible by captured enemy ordnance.

The infantry division had powerful supporting arms. A reconnaissance
regiment equipped with armoured cars of various types provided its own
means of gathering valuable intelligence and to a limited degree of exploiting
success, and a Machine Gun Battalion, equipped with further Vickers .303
MMGs provided additional fire support for infantry both in the attack and
in the defence. Three Royal Engineer Field Squadrons and one Field Park, a
holding unit for various types of heavy equipment, provided the engineer
component of a division. A single Royal Artillery Anti-Tank Regiment,
equipped with 48 2-pdr anti-tank guns, shouldered the burden of anti-tank
defence in each infantry division. Each regiment was organized into four
batteries, in turn each having three troops of eight guns, whose weapons were
parcelled out to infantry units as and when the situation demanded. These
units had originally formed in 1938 when it had been decided that infantry
units already had too many different types of weapon on strength. An Anti-
Aircraft Regiment, equipped with 50 40mm Bofors light anti-aircraft guns,
was similarly parcelled out to provide air defence for other divisional assets.
The main source of organic firepower within each infantry division came
from three Royal Artillery field artillery regiments, equipped with 25-pdr
gun/howitzers, each deploying 24 guns organized into three batteries of eight
guns each. These highly effective weapons, however, were often sucked into
the battle because of deficiencies of existing anti-tank guns, whose 2-pdrs
lacked both range and penetration against new variants of German armour,

and then Xill Corps in the Western
Desert. (4700-32 E 2623)

The officers and men of Eighth Army did not always fight in the desert in
conventionally structured formations, but also served in a number of small
ad-hoc groupings. This included such irregular formations as the Long Range
Desert Group and the Special Air Service. This was a reflection of a common
British practice of forming ad-hoc groupings known as ‘forces’ or ‘columns’ for
specific tasks, which was in many ways a hangover from colonial campaigning.

The ‘Jock Column’ ~ named after Lt. Col. ‘Jock’ Campbell of 4th RHA, who
initially pioneered them - was perhaps the best known, and was a product of
conditions during the early stages of the Desert War when men and equipment
were in short supply. It quickly became part of the tactical system used by British
forces during the Desert War and proved highly popular amongst junior officers,
since they provided an ideal opportunity of exercising independent command.
A Jock Column normally consisted of a single company of motorized infantry, a
battery of field guns and a handful of armoured cars, whose task was to prevent
enemy reconnaissance units from discovering friendly dispositions, misleading
them as to British intentions and lastly for harassment. These small motorized
and highly mobile independent columns also helped convince an enemy that
they were facing a much larger force than was really the case and conserve
equipment in periods between major operations.

The success achieved by Jock Columns against the Italian Army during the
early war years, however, led the British commanders in the desert to over-
exaggerate their fighting power when confronted by a far better organized,
equipped and trained German opponent. As a result, Jock Columns and their
ilk were employed by Eighth Army long after they had outlived their
usefulness. Jock Columns were resurrected again in November 1941, for
example, during Rommel’s dash for the wire during Operation Crusader, where
they did ‘excellent work and inflicted considerable damage and casualties
on enemy formations and Transport.’ In a letter dated S December 1941,
Auchinleck wrote in glowing terms: ‘These “Jock” columns of which more and
more are being organized are just what we want ... They seem to suit our
particular genius for fighting, and are certainly going at the enemy with the
greatest relish and vigour.’ Unfortunately the formation of Jock Columns
often led to the weakening of more and more regular formations at crucial
moments and reinforced the existing widespread tendency to split up
units with all too disastrous effects, especially for the artillery. In April 1942
Auchinleck laid down an authoritative policy for organizing and employing
Jock Columns, clearly stating they were suitable for harassing or pursuing weak
enemy rearguards, but they could not drive home an attack, except against very
weak enemy forces, nor deny ground except for short periods of time. Their
use, moreover, dispersed artillery support and made troops far too accustomed
to tip-and-run raids, so that they regarded all-out attacks or protracted defences
as exceptions rather than the rule. Accordingly, Auchinleck directed that
henceforward Jock Columns should be used sparingly for suitable tasks, such
as raids, harassing, covering and delaying operations in front of defensive
positions on a definite plan, in support of armoured cars on reconnaissance,
and lastly in particular circumstances in the pursuit. By mid 1942 opinion had
decisively turned against them. In the words of Maj. Gen. Frank Messervy, who
had employed them to harass Rommel’s advancing troops when commanding
Ist Armoured Division as the British withdrew from El Agheila to Gazala in
January-February 1942: ‘We are very liable to send out columns hither and
thither; they achieved little and use up a large proportion of our guns, which
are not then available, or at any rate are not fit and fresh for the main battle."

The post-Operation Crusader changes in
organization

The aftermath of Operation Crusader in November/December 1941 showed
that the British High Command still had a great deal to learn about organizing
and handling large armoured formations on a desert battlefield, especially
regarding using tanks en masse, practising effective combined armed tactics
and massing forces at the decisive point.

The tank-heavy 7th Armoured Division — bolstered on and off with a third
armoured brigade ~ did not perform particularly well during Operation Crusader.
Indeed, the Armoured Division, periodically organized in three tank brigades
and a Support Group, proved too large, unwieldy and difficult to command
and control, especially in relation to concerting the action of its constituent
formations. Time and time again its widely dispersed armoured brigades acted
alone and repeatedly failed to overcome German anti-tank screens and suffered
heavy losses at the hands of skilfully handled, concentrated German formations
consisting of tanks, motorized infantry and guns. As David French has written:
“british tanks repeatedly charged, unsupported by infantry or artillery, against
German and Italian anti-tank guns, and time and time again they sustained
disproportionate losses.’> When 22nd Armoured Brigade, for example, charged
Italian troops in a prepared position at Bir-el-Gubi on 19 November 1941, it lost
25 Crusaders to anti-tank guns to no result. Indeed, without any supporting
infantry to escort captured Italian gunners, these men quickly put their weapons
back into action against the formation.

The failure to concert the action of the teeth arms — tanks, infantry and
artillery - had been marked. As shown during the Sidi Rezegh battles all too
often the three arms had failed to concert their action on the battlefield
resulting in heavy loss. The Support Group often fought battles of its own
completely independent of the armour, despite its name. During the Sidi Rezegh
battles, for example, and again during Gazala, in the attack it was frequently
left out of battle completely leaving its anti-tank guns largely wasted. On
27 November, while 22nd and 4th Armoured Brigades had successfully checked
the withdrawal of the DAK from the frontier, the absence of the Support Group
meant it escaped that night when tanks withdrew to leaguer and no infantry
and anti-tank guns were available to block the Trigh Capuzzo.

The hard-won experience gained during the winter fighting of 1941-42
quickly convinced Gen. Auchinleck that changes were badly needed in the
organization of armoured and infantry formations in Eighth Army, with the
intention of improving flexibility, co-operation between tanks, infantry and
artillery and lastly to ‘associate the three arms more closely at all times
and in all places.’ In the view of many British officers something akin to
a German Panzer Division was required, with supporting anti-tank and
field artillery far more closely affiliated to other teeth arms. The solution,
Auchinleck believed, lay in organizational decentralization. Early in 1942
he wrote:

Everything we have learned from our operations in Libya goes to show
that the association between armoured units, infantry and artillery must
be far closer than it has ever been before, and that any attempt at
segregation is wrong and most dangerous. I have definitely come to the
conclusion, and so has everyone else with a position of responsibility
here, that the Armoured Brigade Group as a permanent organization is
a necessity and I am not prepared to put armoured troops into battle in
any other form.

Henceforward it was intended that the Brigade Group would become the
standard tactical formation of Eighth Army, capable in theory of being self-
sufficient and of fighting independently of the rest of its parent division. In many
ways this was not a completely new departure. The Brigade Group idea had in
practice been tried by a few formations before and during Crusader, with small
groups of guns providing intimate support to attacking armour and infantry.
Indeed, the adoption of the brigade group organization antedated the desert
campaign of 1941 and was a follow on from the Kirke Report following Dunkirk
and mirrored changes implemented in the UK. It was an idea, moreover, much
in favour in the Indian subcontinent, where GHQ India had developed various
pamphlets on what it termed Extensive Warfare using widely dispersed armoured
forces. This reflected an increasing awareness that enemy tanks were not the only,
or even the principal, threat with which armour had to contend in North Afric

The British armoured division was reorganized into a more balanced
formation in accordance with Auchinleck’s decision by drastically reducing
the amount of tanks and increasing the amount of supporting infantry
and artillery. To do so a complete armoured brigade was struck off the War
