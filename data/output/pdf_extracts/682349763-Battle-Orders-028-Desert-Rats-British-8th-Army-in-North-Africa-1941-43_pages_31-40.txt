The newcomers who joined Western Desert Force could draw on some,
albeit limited, advice from troops who had served in Egypt in its small pre-war
garrison about both fighting methods and doctrine for armoured warfare,
and living, moving and fighting in the desert. Before June 1940 these units
had carried out exercises in the Western Desert during which much had been
learnt about ‘desert lore’, what constituted ‘desert worthy vehicles’ and the
movement of small, highly mobile, mechanized forces across featureless desert
terrain. A great deal still remained to be learnt about the desert, however,
especially in relation to a war using large numbers of vehicles.

These troops in Egypt were heavily influenced by Maj.Gen. Percy Hobart, a
doyen of the Royal Tank Corps in the 1930s and GOC of the Mobile Division
(Egypt), later re-designated 7th Armoured Division. Inspired by the ideas of
Maj. Gen. J.RC. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart, this prickly and strong-minded
individual fervently believed that forces exclusively consisting of tanks would
exert a decisive effect on all fighting, with armoured
formations operating widely dispersed across a
battlefield and suddenly concentrating at decisive
points. By using manoeuvre and surprise alone,
tanks would play a key role in securing victory.
Unfortunately this belief meant Hobart badly neglected
inter-arm co-operation, largely relegating infantry and
artillery to a very subordinate role, and little thought
was ever given to how the other teeth arms could assist
in destroying enemy armour or be used in the desert.
As Carver has noted: ‘The problem of how to employ
infantry in the desert, and therefore how to organize
and equip it, was never satisfactorily solved.’! Under
his command this formation was intensively trained in
accordance with his bullish belief that armoured units
would have a paramount role in a future conflict.
Although Hobart was dismissed in November 1939,
over differences with his commander on doctrine, his

ideas about the supremacy of the tank were widely accepted in 7th Armoured
Division and lived on during the early war years. It proved a very unfortunate
legacy and ultimately cost the Desert Army dear. Indeed, according to Tim Place:
‘The tactics in which Major General Hobart trained the Mobile Division in Egypt
in 1938-39 set the pattern for the tactics which would bring defeat after defeat
at Rommel’s hands in 1941 and 1942."

The influence of doctrine - the effect

of Operation Compass

The experience gained by Western Desert Force during early operations against
the Italian Army in Libya, culminating in the Battle of Beda Fomm in February
1941, exerted a powerful influence on the Desert Army until late 1942. These
operations showed all the strengths of the pre-war army and, along with what
the Germans had achieved in 1939-40, apparently fully vindicated the doctrine
developed by Hobart, clearly showing that the British armed forces possessed
considerable skill at waging fast-moving armoured warfare under desert
conditions. To many officers it appeared that O'Connor had perfected a
completely new style of mobile warfare and that the British had particular skill
at or affinity for desert fighting. As Perret has noted: ‘This was simple minded
nonsense. If Wavell’s troops had lived, fought and maintained themselves with
less difficulty than the Italians it was because they had been trained to do so
in a hard school - Hobart’s.'! Against an opponent labouring under immense
and myriad difficulties imposed from poor leadership, diabolical equipment
and lacking sufficient motor transport to operate effectively in the desert,
the British armed force appeared far better fitted to the peculiar demands of
living, moving and fighting under desert conditions in terms of tanks, motor
transport, command, control and intelligence.

7th Armoured Division and other troops in Western Desert Force learnt
much that was simply wrong from the defeat of the Italians. Those who
believed manoeuvre and mobility and shock effect by tanks alone could
achieve a decisive result on an enemy's mind found their faith fully justified
in the early desert campaign against the Italians, It also showed that the wide
dispersal of armoured formations could bring major tactical benefits. Indeed,
a wide degree of dispersion, adopted originally from sheer lack of numbers
and low ratio of forces to space and accentuated both as a means of reducing
vulnerability to air attack and of deception where concealment was impossible,
became the hallmark of the desert veterans. The use of Jock Columns also
appeared vindicated. The downside of Operation Compass, however, was that
it taught the Commonwealth armies nothing about tank infantry cooperation
or the proper handling of the artillery in support of mechanized formations
Neither did the use of anti-tank guns feature in the lessons of the campaign.
Last but by no means least, it taught officers of the RTC that great undue risks
could be taken with apparent impunity.

Harsh German lessons

The arrival of the German Wehrmacht in February 1941, in the shape of the
mechanized Deutsches Afrika Korps (the nucleus of Panzerarmee Afrika), ushered
in a radically new phase of the war in the desert. Early painful encounters quickly
showed the British still had much to learn about armoured fighting methods,
in particular about handling large tank formations in the desert, combined
arms tactics and concentrating force at the decisive point. The Germans, with
considerable experience of successful all-arm mechanized operations, quickly
showed, that they were tougher, more determined and better skilled at armoured
combat than their Commonwealth opponents, exploding the myth that the
British had mastered desert warfare. They displayed a quite remarkable ability to
quickly adapt to the desert and its ways. Indeed, the Germans ruthlessly exposed
the shortcomings of British fighting methods and doctrine during their
counteroffensive and the ill-fated operations Battleaxe and Brevity. Whereas the
British still clung to the notion that tank battles should be fought as all-tank
affairs by a dispersed armoured ‘queen’ of the battlefield, the Germans were
more aware of their limitations. The Germans placed considerable emphasis
on concentration for force, effective combined-arms tactics and massing their
strength at the decisive point. In particular, the Germans had realized the full
potential of the offensive use of anti-tank guns as the real killers of enemy
armour, rather than tanks themselves, As Paddy Griffith neatly put it:

This profound imbalance in operation and practice between the two sides
made for combats in which the British tended to rush forward into the
fray while the Germans sheltered behind or between the fires of their
concealed, low-lying anti-tank guns. This was not a tank battle at all but
a shooting gallery.!?

Initially, confusion and bafflement ensued during the summer of 1941 while
the British High Command tried to understand the reasons for German
battlefield success and to ‘close the doctrine gap’ between the two sides. Few
realised the real enemy of the British tanks was the German anti-tank gun.

The lessons of Operation Crusader
The erroneous lessons and tactics learnt in the early stages of the Desert War
against the Italians still exerted a baleful influence on the early battles waged
by Eighth Army. Indeed, Operation Crusader showed that its fighting methods
had considerable shortcomings and it suffered repeated defeats at the tactical
and operational level. Many Commonwealth units and formations were slow
to manoeuvre, lacked the flexibility and the aggressiveness of their German
opponents, and failed to seize fleeting opportunities when offered. A trenchant
ctitique by Panzergruppe Afrika of its opponents following Crusader noted: 'The
slowness and clumsiness, the lack of initiative and tactical versatility observed
up to date has not changed. There was no alteration in tactical planning as the
battle developed in a way which had not been expected beforehand.’3

The Eighth Army displayed particular shortcomings vis-A-vis their
opponents during Crusader and into the spring of 1942, especially in placing
far too much emphasis on the fighting power of tanks unaided and a
continuing deeply entrenched belief that armoured warfare was exclusively a
tank versus tank affair. Repeated unsupported attacks had been made by British
armour against unsuppressed German and Italian anti-tank guns, fighting in
defensive positions of their own choosing, which made up a high proportion

of all German combat units. Effective combined-arms tactics were marked by
their absence during such ‘Balaclava’ charges. To quote one eyewitness:

Time and time again tanks motored or charged at the enemy on a broad
front until the leading troops were knocked out by enemy tanks or anti-
tank guns: the momentum of the attack immediately failed. Such artillery
as was supporting the tanks indulged in some spattering of the enemy ...
after which the tanks motored about or charged again with the same
results as before ... the infantry taking no part, their task being to follow
up and occupy the objective after it had been captured by the tanks.!#

‘A heavy penalty was paid in destroyed tanks for the failure to coordinate
supporting infantry and artillery fire and lack of realization that the Germans
were using their anti-tank guns as the main killer of British armour. Indeed, the
latter in North Africa accounted for a higher proportion of British tank losses
(40 per cent) than did hostile tanks (38 per cent), according to an Operational
Research report produced after the war ended. Following the Gazala battles
the second in command of a squadron in 22nd Armoured Brigade reported: ‘A
frontal attack by armour on a defended position, and an attack of this kind by
cavalry tanks, though even then considered part of their role, is one of the
surest methods of suicide that exists.’

‘The fighting during the winter and later during the spring showed that
Eighth Army still placed far too much emphasis on mobility and manoeuvre
and wide dispersal of its forces, which militated against concentration of force
at the decisive point. An obsession with passive air defence still gripped the
British Army long after its real need had passed, resulting in wide tactical
dispersion. In particular, Eighth Army's fighting strength was badly fragmented
by a tendency to employ independent brigades in combat, often operating at
a considerable distance from its neighbours, to fight its battles, rather than in
divisions. All too often brigades were set upon by complete German divisions
and destroyed in detail. It was also shown by the continued widespread use of
Jock Columns, which effectively dissipated the fighting power of formations. A
heavy price, for example, was paid for dispersing 7th Support Group into Jock
Columns during the later stages of Operation Crusader to harass German forces
operating throughout the battlefield. Perhaps the most serious downside of this
tendency was that it prevented the concentrated use of artillery, in which the
British enjoyed growing superiority in quality, quantity and professionalism.

The tendency towards dispersion was also reflected in the defensive
methods employed by Eighth Army during 1942. The immensity of the
featureless desert and low force to space ratios made a linear defence an
impossibility for much of the Desert War. Instead, the British developed the
idea of defensive ‘boxes’, invented by Maj. Gen. Frank Messervy, consisting of
all-round defensive localities containing dug-in infantry, anti-tank guns and
artillery protected by thick belts of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. These
were normally constructed at a key position on the battlefield blocking a line
of approach, defile or similar key terrain feature. Vulnerable motor transport
was normally sent away, since it could not be protected from enemy fire
without each vehicle being dug in, leaving a garrison largely immobile in the
fluid conditions of desert warfare. A box, moreover, was intended to act as a
pivot of manoeuvre around which mobile armoured forces could advance or
retire, attacking enemy penetrations, and if necessary collect ammunition and
petrol from dumps. These defensive localities were in themselves an effective
response to battlefield realities, but only if they were within supporting range
of similar defences and/or sufficiently powerful counter-attack forces capable of

giving them succour. If left isolated they proved all too vulnerable to massed
enemy attack, which simply overran or destroyed them.

The main lesson Eighth Army learnt from Operation Crusader was that
improving combined-arms tactics, especially in the attack, was essential. No
longer was armoured warfare diagnosed exclusively as an armoured business.
On 30 January 1942 Auchinleck wrote:

We have got to face the fact that, unless we can achieve superiority on the
battlefield by better co-operation between the arms, and more original
leadership ... we may have to forego any idea of mounting a strategical
offensive, because our armoured forces are incapable of meeting the
enemy in the open, even when superior to him in number.!°

Overcoming belief in ‘pure’ tank battles and therefore improving combined
arms was particularly difficult, since it was so deeply entrenched in the minds
of old desert hands. Following Crusader the HQ of Eighth Army directed
that ‘tanks must never move, once contact has been made, unless adequately
covered by artillery.’ The main function of tanks remained to seek out and
destroy enemy armour, but ‘tanks alone cannot win battles ... In the armoured
divisions tanks must act in the closest co-operation with infantry and artillery
in order to defeat the German armoured forces.”

The British High Command sought to improve flexibility and combined
arms primarily by tinkering with organization rather than fundamentally
changing fighting methods and doctrine, with the formation of Armoured
Brigade Groups as discussed previously. While potentially a major step forward
in improving combat capability, the downside was that it dispersed the
available supporting artillery and exacerbated the problem of dispersion
already evident in Eighth Army. It was magnified by the resurrection of Jock
‘Columns during the summer and small formations by Auchinleck.

Eighth Army made an effort to identify its mistakes, learn and make changes
in its doctrine and fighting methods during 1942, although what had actually
happened and the measures needed in response were not always agreed upon.
The main medium for passing on information was via guidelines, issued by

formation commanders and distributed to subordinate units, that provided
training instructions. Later new lessons learnt were laid down in periodically
produced Middle East Command Army Training Memoranda, albeit often only
after a lengthy time delay. In turn these lessons learnt by Eighth Army passed
on to Cairo and then onwards to the War Office in London. The progress
actually made in making the requisite changes was slow and haphazard due to
a number of factors. It was difficult — virtually impossible - to make major
changes while fighting was in progress. A capable senior commander - with
sufficient clarity of mind, experience and authority to recognize the need for
and oversee such far-reaching changes in thought, doctrine and action — was
marked by his absence. Indeed, to an extent commanders’ ideas were still in
flux, with Auchinleck still approving, it appears, a degree of dispersion of the
battlefield. A follow-on from this was that Middle East Command and Eighth
Army lacked a unifying authority to identify what was happening on the
battlefield and as a result still made serious errors about what the Germans
were actually doing. Lastly, Eighth Army suffered from a high turnover in
commanders, staffs and formations during the Desert War, which militated
against learning from experience and making changes. Part of the problem
delaying much needed changes in Eighth Army’s approach to battle was that
senior RAC officers blamed reasons other than combined arms for failure.
‘These included the inexperience of commanders, lack of training, a dearth of
arms and equipment, lack of air superiority and lastly the supposedly poor
quality of British tanks, especially in armament and mechanical reliability.

The Eighth Army made some progress in improving some of the faults
identified during Crusader, but it was too little and too late and these efforts
were largely overtaken by events. No time was available for a revision of
doctrine and essential retraining to put new ideas into effect. As a result it
repeated many of the same errors during the Gazala battles and the precipitate
withdrawal to El Alamein during the summer of 1942, in terms of dispersion
and failure to concert action between the teeth arms, especially during attacks
against German positions on ground of their own choosing heavily defended
by anti-tank guns. Indeed, the British never developed a successful method
of making a concerted attack using infantry and tanks, least of all in fluid
mobile fighting, backed by massed firepower of field artillery to neutralize
powerful enemy anti-tank guns/other defences until Second El Alamein. This
was largely due to continued over-emphasis on dispersion, which fragmented
the firepower of the most effective arm - the gunners. The British armour
suffered its greatest defeats of the Desert War on 12-13 June 1942, when in a
serious of confused actions, tanks of 2nd, 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades,
fighting under 1st Armoured Division, impaled themselves yet again on
Rommel’s anti-tank guns. On 22 July, 2nd and 22nd Armoured brigades failed
to support 6th New Zealand Brigade, which was overrun. 23rd Armoured
Brigade charged once again into the attack, and overall the British lost 121
tanks compared to German losses of three. A profound distrust between
infantry and armour quickly emerged.

Montgomery -— a return to attrition

The Eighth Army still appeared baffled as to how to conduct a fluid open battle
in the Western Desert in August 1942. Efforts to devise an effective doctrine
and improve combat effectiveness had still largely failed. Fortunately it never
had to really do so ever again. The Eighth Army that had rebuffed Rommel’s
advance at First El Alamein perhaps fortunately now faced a very different
stage of the Desert War, and was under a new commander who had firm ideas
about war fighting. Indeed, Lt. Gen. Bernard Montgomery was the first senior
desert commander of Eighth Army who really had the time, opportunity,
will, ruthlessness and confidence to impose his own ideas about doctrine and
fighting methods. A common doctrine, standard operating procedures and

battle drills modelled in large part on their opponents
were introduced on an army-wide basis.

The war machine he commanded was very
different from that before, with new and far greater
tanks, powerful support artillery and far more troops.
By late 1942 the majority of Eighth Army units,
moreover, had combat experience and had built up a
cadre of trained and experienced officers, NCOs and
ORs who knew the business of desert warfare

The new GOC Eighth Army faced a very different
and arguably easier task than his predecessors who
had fought in the limitless, open desert - breaking into
and through a short, linear German defensive
position resting on secure flanks running from the
Mediterranean to the Quatarra Depression. It meant
that unlike previous commanders Montgomery did
not have to fight a fast-moving war of manoeuvre in
the desert. Instead, he had to mount a breakthrough
attack on a limited front against fixed flanks held by
an opponent of inferior strength and in dire logistical
shape. The Eighth Army from El Alamein onwards
adopted fighting methods and largely fought the type
of war ~ based on ‘older and sounder principles’, according to one historian -
it and the British Army as a whole knew, understood and was good at, namely
massed attacks employing heavy artillery firepower on a comparatively narrow
front. Many commanders were keen to return to them, especially those at sea
in mobile desert warfare. In place of manoeuvre, firepower was used to batter
down Axis opponents in an attritional battle, and thereby reduce their ability
to inflict losses. Indeed, in many ways these battles it fought and won bore
a similarity to those on the Western Front during World War I, in which the
British pitted their strengths against Axis weaknesses rather than fighting the
Germans on their own terms as before. Several important differences, however,
existed, with the British deploying far less artillery, but having powerful
support from tactical air forces and new and improved tanks.

The approach that worked so well at El Alamein was followed for the rest
of the Desert War, such as at Medenine and the Mareth Line. Henceforward
British attacks in North Africa were carefully stage-managed, and were reliant
on superior massed firepower and meticulous planning at all levels. These
methods were necessary for other reasons. For the armoured brigades the
pendulum had swung from one extreme to another in terms of their approach
to battle, Following earlier heavy combat losses, many now wisely abandoned
charging enemy positions and adopted instead a policy of extreme caution, in
part explaining the bodged pursuit after the battle, and a failure to exploit after
later battles such as Wadi Akarit. While not as glamorous as earlier tank battles
in the open desert, Montgomery's methods worked.

Training for desert warfare

The senior British commanders who served in North Africa were well aware of
the critical importance of a high level of individual instructions and collective
training, carried out at unit and formation level, as a key means of improving
combat effectiveness. Training was always an ongoing process carried out
whenever an opportunity offered in the line, or on the rare opportunities when
units and formations withdrew into the rear areas. A major training deficit,
however, existed in most British Commonwealth formations throughout the
Desert War. This was not an isolated problem and reflected the overall poor
standard of instruction in the British armed forces as a whole during the early
war years. The British Army in 1940-43, like the rest of the Commonwealth

======================================================================
PAGE 39
======================================================================

armed forces, was the victim of the massive expansion since the outbreak of
war, which caused a massive slump in overall combat effectiveness. Hard
training was required to rectify this shortfall. All too often during the early
war years the British Army had to train and use its troops on the battlefield
at the same time. Instruction respectively was the responsibility of unit and
formation commanders and was an ongoing process carried out at all times -
even on active service in the desert ~ whenever an opportunity offered itself.

Such instruction was based upon written sources of doctrine such as FSR,
training instructions issued by formation commanders, and, lastly, advice
gleaned from experienced officers and units. The willingness of individuals
to learn by actually reading the manuals or listening to and acting upon the
advice of others, however, was also an important element in ensuring that a
high standard of efficiency was reached.

‘The Western Desert Force had already learnt the hard way the danger of
committing inexperienced and poorly trained formations to battle, and that
much still remained to be learnt by Commonwealth troops. In large part
the destruction of the ill-fated 2nd Armoured Division in March-April had
been largely due to a lack of individual and collective training. A Training
Memorandum issued by Middle East Command in June 1941 began: ‘A war
of movement such as this one requires troops to be trained to a considerably
higher degree than was necessary in the last wa.”

The Western Desert Force had already identified key personal skills and
knowledge that needed to be imparted during training to the desert soldier,
in addition to a high standard of individual and collective training for
modern warfare.

The conduct of military operations in the ‘Blue’ required distinctive
training, as well as a period of physical and psychological acclimatization for
Commonwealth troops for whom this was a challenging environment. To the
majority, life in a desert environment came as a profound shock, with few
realizing what it would be like in advance. For most the desert was a tedious
and unfriendly place posing a range of threats to life and limb in itself that
required training and experience to overcome. A period of time was needed for
all ranks to adjust to the extremes of heat and cold, dust, flies, shortages of
water and the limited unpalatable diet. As one desert veteran later wrote:

Newcomers to the desert with their ‘white knees’, were urged to become
‘desert-wise’ or ‘desert-worthy’, to learn to navigate, to cook for
themselves, to conserve water, to ‘harbour’ or ‘leaguer’ in the accepted
way. At the same time they absorbed a healthy, or unhealthy, respect for
Rommel and his tanks imparted by the old desert hand.1?

‘The development of ‘desert sense’ ~ a term vaguely defined as an ability to live
and move in the desert with confidence and ease - was judged an essential part
of preparation for life in the desert. It involved the possession of different
skills and knowledge. The ability to move and navigate across the featureless
desert was an essential skill, using the stars, sun, magnetic or sun compasses,
milometers, and map reading, as well as good memory. Indeed, it was a matter
of life and death, given the harsh terrain and absence of drinking water, that
required careful conservation and water discipline essential. Hygiene discipline
was of key importance, with water shortages limiting washing and endemic
skin diseases; in particular, desert sores resistant to treatment abounded.

The infantry needed particular skills for desert fighting, which always
demanded a high level of discipline, skill-at-arms and careful fieldcraft to find or
make cover in such open terrain. In particular, marksmanship was of particular
importance given the long ranges at which most engagements took place.

‘The mechanized war waged in the desert required other skills such as driving
in widely dispersed desert formations spread out over miles of ground and
leaguering at night for protection. A practised eye was needed to recognize
undulations, depressions and other accidents of ground providing covered
approaches, positions for defensive layouts and hull-down positions for tanks.
The conduct of armoured warfare under desert conditions placed great demand
on crews and high levels of training were required in driving, navigation, tank
gunnery, inter-communications and vehicle recognition. For AFV crews an
essential skill was to find cover in the slightest undulations in the ground and
hull-down positions, and desert driving. The maintenance of vehicles formed
part of essential desert skills and of greater importance than elsewhere given the
high rate of wear and tear caused by desert grit and sand - letting air out of tyres
as they heated, almost constantly checking engines were free form dust or gravel,
and carefully checking weapons for dust that might jam the mechanisms.

‘The necessity for higher-level formations ~ brigades, divisions and corps - to
carry out a period of collective training, during which constituent units learnt
to work together as a team, was also judged essential for successful desert
fighting. It became more important as pre-war regular army formations at a
high pitch of training were either destroyed or heavily diluted by replacement
officers and men. Such time was frequently unavailable, however, during the
early days of Western Desert Force and Eighth Army. The Commonwealth
formations arriving in theatre for the first time in particular needed good
individual and collective training to fit them for desert fighting. Although the
War Office requested that formations be supplied with the latest tactical lessons
and general information from the Middle East to enable them to study fighting
under such conditions, there were limits as to what training could be done in
the temperate climate of the UK where few large training areas existed. When
formations arrived in theatre they often required much training before they
were ready for combat. A consensus quickly developed that it was necessary to
give troops three months’ training after they arrived from Europe before they
could confidently be committed to battle. Writing in June-1942 under intense
pressure to commit newly arrived troops to battle, Auchinleck fought back: ‘We
have learned by experience that troops fresh from the UK are a liability rather
than an asset in desert fighting until they have had the requisite training.’®
