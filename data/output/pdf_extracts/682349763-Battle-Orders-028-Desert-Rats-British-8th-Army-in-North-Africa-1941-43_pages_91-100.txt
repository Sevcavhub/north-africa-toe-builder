Lessons learned

The war waged by Eighth Army in the far-flung arid wastes of the Western
Desert occupies a special place in the history of the British armed forces during
World War Il. For three long years it represented the single most important
land campaign the British were fighting and the only opportunity to strike
back on land against the might of Nazi Germany. Although in the final analysis
the Desert War was a sideshow, with the defeat of Nazi Germany determined in
the Soviet Union and later North-West Europe, it played an important part in
the development of British arms. A vital tradition of success and belief in the
ability of British Commonwealth troops to win was firmly established at the
Battle of El Alamein as well as a firm belief that British soldiers could and would
defeat their Axis opponents. It was also a massive fillip to morale for the British
public. Eighth Army rounded off this victory by carrying out a remarkable
pursuit of the remaining enemy forces to Tunisia, where it shared, along with
US and British landed during Operation Torch, the final destruction of the Axis
forces in North Africa.

The Eighth Army played a pivotal role in the process of improving the
combat effectiveness of the British Army as a whole during World War II, with
the Western Desert acting as a vital training and proving ground for war-raised
officers, men, new equipment and concepts of war. Although it began well
with Eighth Army securing a victory during Operation Crusader, British
Commonwealth forces suffered defeat after embarrassing and bewildering
defeat at the hands of Axis troops, from which much had to be learnt. The
Desert War provided the vital first experience of using predominantly tank-
based forces spread out over the period June 1940-May 1943. Lessons learnt

fighting in the ‘the great sand table’ and the experience gained played an
important role in preparing it for a long-awaited second front in Europe.
Indeed, it has been compared to the 1808-14 Peninsular campaign in many
ways. In a sense, the Desert War was a decisive loss of innocence, from which
was born the new Montgomery era.

‘The Eighth Army had learnt much by the end of the Desert War. Indeed,
a new sense of professionalism, confidence and will to win pervaded it in
the spring of 1943. Even so, Eighth Army in general, without doubt, never
achieved the same degree of professionalism as its German opponents. The
British had adapted well to living and moving in the harsh, difficult and
unforgiving terrain and climate of North Africa and life in the ‘Blue’, but the
same cannot be said of its ability to wage armoured warfare against the highly
skilled Wehrmacht. Indeed, successive commanders of Fighth Army arguably
never really understood and came to grips with the tactical and operational
conduct of high-tempo, fast-moving, armoured warfare waged across a broad
featureless desert landscape, which in many ways appeared the acme of
what pre-war visionaries had predicted for tank warfare. Senior British officers
proved slow in identifying and learning from painful experience the right
lessons about waging armoured warfare under desert conditions. It took too
long to rectify glaring defects in British organization, equipment, command
and control, fighting methods and training. A powerful defence can be
mounted of British generalship, however, given the myriad difficulties it
operated under. Eighth Army, like its predecessors, struggled in overcoming
the massive expansion of the small peacetime army, with its consequent
lowering of general efficiency and training, and chronic shortages of and the
unsuitability of existing equipment. A constant turnover of formations and
commanders also militated against a good understanding of the conduct of
armoured warfare in the desert. As a result Eighth Army never really settled
down until Montgomery arrived. This contrasts sharply with the Axis who kept
pretty much the same commanders and formations in the field throughout the
Desert War. Twenty different formations went into battle between Sidi Barrani
and Second El Alamein. Only 11 were present at Second Alamein, of which
three were making their desert debut. Only 11 fought in more than one major
battle and only four fought in more than two battles. Many formations also
suffered from frequent changeovers in their constituent units. 7th Armoured
Division, moreover, had some 17 different armoured regiments and nine
infantry battalions under its command at different times. All these changes
militated against institutional familiarity or continuity of experience.

The final defeat of Rommel ironically was not won in a fast-moving
armoured battle, instead being achieved in old-fashioned attritional battles,
bolstered by very superior numbers, powerful concentrated artillery support,
close air support, the availability of modern AFVs and vastly superior logistics
around El Alamein. The set-piece fighting methods, operational doctrine, and
techniques developed by Montgomery lacked the same glamour of armoured
warfare but proved in the final analysis highly effective. They exploited the
full capability of better combined-arms tactics, qualitatively superior weapons
at his disposal, massed artillery, air support, careful planning, and superior
logistics, at which the British excelled

‘The campaign fought and won by Eighth Army helped establish a particular
kudos for the desert soldiers, whose experiences were shaped by the desert and
fighting against Axis troops. Following El Alamein, to be a member of Eighth
Army was (and still is) regarded as a particular distinction. Indeed, many former
Desert Rats looked down on other British soldiers, especially those of Ist Army
newly sent out from the UK. It is indeed fortunate that the best traditions of
Eighth Army and its officers and men live on to the present day. 7th Armoured
Brigade still proudly wears the Jerboa flash and bears the nickname ‘the Desert
Rats’ with pride.
