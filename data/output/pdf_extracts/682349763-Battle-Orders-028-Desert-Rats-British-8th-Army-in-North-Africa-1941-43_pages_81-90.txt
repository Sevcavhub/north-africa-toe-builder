22nd Armoured Brigade and the New Zealanders. A short, sharp skirmish
occurred shortly before dusk, after which both sides drew apart and leaguered
for the night

The ensuing defensive battle fought by Eighth Army beginning the next
day took the course Montgomery had planned, with 15th Panzer Division
and then 21st Panzer Division effectively impaling themselves on anti-tank
defences manned by two armoured brigades and 44th Division, backed by
devastating powerful divisional and corps artillery support. Heavy losses were
inflicted on the German armour by dug-in anti-tank guns and hull-down
tanks along the ridge occupying carefully prepared defensive positions, who
refused to be enticed out of their defences and engage in a mélée as the
Germans, by past experience, hoped. When the Germans retired to refuel at
nightfall, fierce bombing raids on their leaguers again caused serious losses
amongst manpower, tanks and especially soft-skin vehicles, which were
especially targeted. The next day German attacks were equally unsuccessful,
pounded by intense artillery fire, while further north the supporting Italians
were still struggling to clear the minefields. 90th Light had also made little
progress further northwards. The British defences were steadily reinforced,
meanwhile, with elements of divisions further north shifted in support of
those engaged near the Alam el Halfa feature. Furthermore, 151st Brigade was
ordered from the Delta to the eastern end of the ridge. Orders were issued to
the New Zealand Division to prepare an attack southwards from Alam Nay!
towards Himeimat. Spoiling attacks were also made by XXX Corps in the
north to throw the Axis forces off-balance.

The end was clearly in sight for the German offensive, with the DAK
effectively penned in by Allied formations and forced to fight an offensive
battle against superior forces on ground of British choosing. With stocks of
fuel and ammunition plummeting, under sustained bombardment and aerial
attack and lastly with intelligence that British armoured forces were massing,
Rommel accepted the fact British forces could not be tempted from their
positions into the open to fight a fluid and mobile battle. Early on 2 September
the German High Command ordered a gradual withdrawal, under heavy attack
by the Desert Air Force, back to the western edge of the British minefields. By
midday on 3 September it was fully underway. Fortunately for the Germans,
Montgomery proved extremely cautious given the large armoured forces at
his disposal. Given the low state of British training for offensive operations he
only ordered a vigorous pursuit of the withdrawing enemy forces, apart from
a deliberate attack by the New Zealanders and 132nd Infantry Brigade on
the night of 3/4 September towards the Munassib Depression. Heavy fighting
ensued, with the German and Italian defenders offering fierce resistance, and
ultimately 6th New Zealand Brigade withdrew having suffered heavy losses,
including its commander. Similarly 132nd Brigade lost heavily with its
commanding officer severely injured, and 697 officers and men were casualties.

The Battle of Alam el Halfa was a resounding success for British arms, with
Panzerarmee Afrika ending its last major offensive directed towards Egypt
back behind the British minefields, apart from positions around the peak of
Himeimat. The careful preparations begun by Auchinleck and completed by
Montgomery to meet this attack had paid massive dividends. It had cost the
Germans 369 dead, 1,163 wounded and 272 missing, and the Italians 167
men killed, 587 wounded and 197 missing. A total of 36 German and 11
Italian tanks or armoured reconnaissance vehicles were lost. Large numbers
of soft-skin vehicles were also destroyed. In comparison, Eighth Army lost
1,750 casualties and its tank strength remained pretty much as before.
Perhaps most importantly it was a psychological victory for British arms and
established mutual trust between Eighth Army and its new leader, who had
assumed command just three weeks before. In this short period of time he
had gripped Eighth Army and impressed upon it the vital importance of

standing firm on ground of its own choosing. A now reorganized,
rejuvenated and confident Eighth Army had shown it was more than capable
under the leadership of Montgomery of defeating Rommel and the Axis
forces at its own game, especially when provided at last with ample firepower.
With morale restored, Eighth Army now turned to preparing itself for its own
decisive offensive in the Western Desert. In comparison, Rommel had not
shown his customary drive and enthusiasm; Panzerarmee Afrika had shot its
bolt and was now only capable of standing firm and awaiting the inevitable
British offensive it knew was coming.

Operation Pugilist - Eighth Army and the
Battle of the Mareth Line, March 1943

The victorious Eighth Army’s advance into Tunisia began well in March 1943,
when 7th Armoured Division, part of XXX Corps, captured Ben Gardane and
then the villages of Tatouine and Medenine. Little opposition was initially
encountered. The Axis forces in Tunisia, however, were far from cowed. On
6 March the Germans launched a fierce counterstroke at Medenine across
open desert terrain against the lead elements of Eighth Army. This attack, about
which Montgomery had warning from ULTRA decrypts, never stood a real
chance of success since meticulous defensive plans were already in place by the
time it began. For its assault on XXX Corps the Axis deployed elements of three
Panzer divisions ~ flushed with success after Kasserine-Gafsa ~ fielding 160
tanks, and four two-battalion battlegroups, which attacked under cover of an
early morning fog cloaking the ground. The initial German waves, however,
foundered against a well-prepared defensive position containing dui
infantry and massed anti-tank guns ~ 2-pdrs, 6-pdrs and the first 17-pdrs — after
the sun burned through the fog. Massed field and medium artillery fire,
moreover, opened at short range caused heavy losses on the accompanying
Panzer Grenadiers. Although three more attacks were made the German
Panzers, each suffered the same fate and by the end of the day 55 German tanks
littered the battlefield. By dawn on 7 March the remaining German troops had
fallen back to the Mareth Line, ending Rommel's last battle in North Africa. It
had been a highly successful defensive action for Eighth Army, demonstrating
the growing steadiness, skill and professionalism of its infantry and artillery,
with only 130 ORs killed or wounded and heavy losses in tanks and manpower
inflicted on the enemy.

The British planning staffs immediately resumed work for breaching the
heavily fortified Mareth Line, blocking the only practicable line of advance
into Tunisia, following the German repulse. Originally built by the French to
repel an Italian attack from Tripolitania, this strong line consisted of defensive
localities containing mutually supporting concrete blockhouses, steel gun
cupolas, trenches, barbed wire and extensive anti-personnel and anti-tank
minefields located in naturally strong defensive terrain. It stretched 12 miles
westwards from the Mediterranean coast and was anchored in the south on
the mountainous Matmata Hills, to the west of which was a sand sea assessed
by the French military authorities as impassable. The Wadi Zagzaou, 60-200ft
wide and 20ft deep, formed a natural tank ditch immediately to its front,
behind which another had been artificially constructed. Although Rommel had
lobbied for a withdrawal, believing stronger positions existed elsewhere, the
Italian High Command had stood firm and this formidable defensive position
was held by four Italian and two German divisions, forming part of the Italian
First Army. This fielded approximately 80,000 men equipped with 450 field or
medium guns and 720 anti-tank guns. Two weak Panzer divisions were held in
reserve ready to counter-attack any Allied incursion, with 15th Panzer Division
located five miles north of Mareth. Intercepted British signals had alerted them
to British outline plans.

(4700-39 NA 1008)

The Eighth Army, fielding two corps for this offensive, possessed a
considerable advantage in numbers: 160,000 men, nearly 750 tanks and
nearly 700 field and medium guns, as well as 1,000 AT guns, mostly 6-pdrs.
It was backed by the powerful Desert Air Force, which possessed command
of the air. The sheer strength of these defences meant Montgomery also
looked for other alternatives than just a frontal assault. Indeed, intensive
reconnaissance using the LRDG of the sand sea lying east had already begun
on his orders to gather intelligence, with the intention of outflanking the
Mareth Line by advancing through the Tebaga Gap and then northwards
to El Hamma. Although difficult going, they reported movement was feasible
for vehicles. The final plan for Operation Pugilist involved XXX Corps,
consisting of 50th Division, 51st Division, 4th Indian Division and 201st
Guards Brigade, which would launch a frontal attack on the Mareth Line in
the north, roll up the defences and then advance towards Gabes. A subsidiary
advance by New Zealand Division, meanwhile, reinforced by 8th Armoured
Brigade and the Free French and artillery - known as the New Zealand Corps
- would flank the Matmata Hills to the south and then put a block on the
Gabes-Matmata road. The X Corps, composed of Ist and 7th Armoured
divisions, would remain in reserve, ready to exploit a breakthrough by
advancing on Sfax

The Eighth Army, buoyed up by the German defeat at Medenine, entered
battle brimming with confidence percolating down from its highest ranks to
the lowliest soldier. Operation Pugilist was preceded by several preparatory
attacks by 50th and Sist divisions to capture the enemy outpost line along
the Wadi Zeuss, in advance of Wadi Zigzaou, and Horseshoe Hill, with the
latter involving heavy casualties. The main attack on the Mareth Line began
on the night of 20 March as planned amidst heavy rainfall. 50th Division,
commanded by Maj. Gen. Nichols, would lead the way, with 4th Indian
Division passing through after the initial objectives had been secured. An
intensive artillery and aerial bombardment to soften the defences preceded the
attack, involving 13 field regiments, 3 medium regiments and SO British and
US aircraft. The assault by 151st (Durham) Brigade, supported by S1 Valentine

tanks and a squadron of Scorpion flail tanks to breach enemy minefields in
advance of the Wadi, immediately encountered determined and well-organized
Axis resistance. Similarly the attack by 69th Brigade to seize the Basin, east of
Wadi Zigzaou, to protect its flank met determined resistance.

The leading infantry battalions made steady progress into the Mareth Line's
main defences despite fierce enemy resistance, securing a bridgehead a mile
wide and 800 yards deep, Behind them engineers struggled to break down
the sides of the anti-tank ditch and clear mines for the supporting armour
under intense mortar and enfilade machine-gun fire. With dawn approaching
further operations were postponed until nightfall, with the lead battalions
consolidating their hard-won positions. On 21 March two further battalions
entered the bridgehead, and as the advance continued Italian morale slumped
and large-scale surrenders occurred. The sappers, moreover, passed through
supporting Valentine tanks, despite intense rainfall that impeded their work.
On 22 March the bridgehead was subjected, however, to an intense artillery
bombardment followed by an attack by 30 tanks from 15th Panzer Division,
which quickly destroyed the supporting British armour and pushed the
defenders back to the anti-tank ditch. A supporting attack by 69th Brigade was
stillborn. On the night of 23 March the remaining tanks and infantry fell back
across the Wadi Zigzaou leaving the defences firmly in German hands.

‘The main effort by Eighth Army now switched from the right to the left
flank, given the sudden reversal of fortunes in the bridgehead in the Mareth
Line. While 50th and 51st Divisions, supported by 7th Armoured Division,
contained the enemy near the coast, the remainder of Horrocks’ X Corps joined
the New Zealanders in the outflanking manoeuvre. The New Zealand Corps
had already advanced through Wilders Gap and headed north on 19 March
towards Ksar Rhilane. Unfortunately its presence and outflanking manoeuvre
had already been detected as it raced northwards south of the Matmata Hills
towards the Tebaga Gap. On the 21st it secured an important outpost near
this defile, but before it could breach it elements of 21st Panzer Division and
164th Light Division were transferred to block its advance. Despite this setback
Montgomery ordered his ‘left hook’ to be reinforced with Ist Armoured
Division. 4th Indian Division also advanced, meanwhile, into the Matmata
Hills to outflank the Mareth Line. A heavy aerial bombardment of the defences
took place and the newly strengthened New Zealand Corps launched an attack
on 26 March against the Djebal Melab, with 8th Armoured Brigade in close
support. Ist Armoured Division passed through and advanced at night towards
El Hamma, suffering negligible losses against a confused and disorganized
enemy, leaving the New Zealanders to mop up the remaining enemy. On
27 March it was held up short of its objective, while elements of 21st and 15th
Panzer Divisions attacked its tail some distance behind the leading troops. A
concerted attack with 8th Armoured Brigade and the New Zealanders was made
the following day, with Ist Armoured ion on the defensive, who thrust
towards Gabes over difficult terrain. At the same time 4th Indian Division
reported enemy rearguards were in retreat from the Mareth Line. On the 28th
Ist Armoured Division found El Hamma empty and by midday the King’s
Dragoon Guards had reached Gabes.

The Battle of the Mareth Line ended in a complete victory for Eighth
Army, with the enemy remnants withdrawing in some disorder northwards
back to Wadi Akarit line, where they prepared to make a further determined
stand. It was Fighth Army’s first experience of assaulting a stronghold
consisting of strong fixed defences, and an extremely painful one at that.
Although his first plan had ended in defeat, Montgomery had demonstrated
considerable flexibility after the initial attack had stalled, by switching his
main effort to the left flank and then employing armoured units in a dash to
Gabes. Although Montgomery later claimed this was all part of his original
plan, it clearly was not. The effect on Eighth Army of Medenine, the Battle of

Mareth and the ‘left hook’ was to greatly increase confidence in themselves
and their leader. A key feature of the battle, moreover, was also the close
co-operation between the Desert Air Force and ground troops throughout.

ighth Army’s last battle in North Africa:
Wadi Akarit, 5-6 April 1943

The GOC Eighth Army had originally hoped to force the Gabes Gap ‘on the
run’ following the capture of the Mareth Line. By the time Ist Armoured
Division and the New Zealand Division reached the Wadi Akarit position on 29
March, after a slow advance across very difficult terrain, it had been prepared
for defence. This was another formidable, naturally strong, 18-mile-long
defensive line, partially running along the deep Wadi Akarit, with one flank
resting on the Mediterranean coast and the other by impassable salt marshes
and lakes of the Chort Djerid. Indeed, Rommel had wanted to make a stand
here instead of the Mareth Line. It formed the last natural barrier preventing
access to the coastal plain of Tunisia from the south and a junction between
the Eighth Army and the other Allied forces in Tunisia.

‘The eastern section near the coast ran along the four-mile-long Wadi Akarit,
which had been deepened, widened and mined to make a formidable obstacle.
Two hill features dominated the coastal sector. The Djebel Roumana, a steep-
sided bare ridge running parallel to the coast road about SOOft in height, was
impassable to wheeled vehicles. Between the Djebel Roumana and the next hill
feature was a two-mile gap of rolling open country. The most important part of
the position was a wide, craggy salient about Fatnassa and Zouai - 800ft high ~
in the centre of the Wadi Akarit position known as the Djebal Tebaga Fatnassa,
which commanded the whole front to the east and west. As one observer
described: ‘A series of transverse crests merges in a labyrinthine tangle of
pinnacles, escarpments, counter-escarpments, deep fjord-like chimneys and
corridors.’ To the north-west of Djebel Fatnassa a system of saddleback ridges
ran five miles inland, known as the Djebel Semlet el Beida, to where the Djebel
Haidoudi guarded a metalled road. The western end rested on the great salt
marshes at the Chott el Fedjadj. To complete the defences, an anti-tank ditch
ran from the Wadi Akarit to the Jebel Roumana, and another from Roumana’s
western end to Djebel Tebaga Fatnassa. Over 4,000 anti-tank mines had also
been laid by Axis engineers along the position.

The defending troops of AOK 1 had taken up position in the Akarit positions
on 29 March, deploying elements of 20th and 21st Italian Corps. The Wadi
Akarit position was held near the coast by 20th Corps, which consisted of the
Young Fascist Division, two battalions of 90th Light Division, Trieste Division,
and La Spezia Division. 21st Corps held the western end of the defences with
(from east to west) Pistoia, a detachment of 15th Panzer Division, the remnants
of 164th Light Division and the Saharan Group. In reserve were the remaining
weak units of 90th Light Division and 15th Panzer Division. While on paper
formidable, the defenders lacked tanks, artillery and other equipment, as well
as being critically short of arms and ammunition.

The British High Command began planning immediately for a deliberate
frontal attack using XXX Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Oliver Leese, with X
Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Horrocks, in reserve to exploit a breakthrough,
since this 12-mile-long position could not be outflanked. This initial plan of
attack, however, was quickly discarded after patrolling by 4th Indian Division,
commanded by Maj. Gen. Francis Tuker, discovered weaknesses in the defences
on the Djebel Fatnassa, which was quickly identified as the key to the position.
Although this craggy salient was well defended by elements of the Italian
Pistoia and La Spezia Divisions and the remnants of the German 64th Light
Division, too few troops were available to mount an effective defence, and its
defences were sited looking out eastwards and westwards, since it was judged

surrendering. Complete surprise was obtained and no German counter-attack
materialized. A route onto the Djebel Maida for tracks and wheels was
constructed and the anti-tank ditch was breached by Indian sappers, to allow
forward elements of 10th Corps to advance. Unfortunately it remained inactive
despite repeated calls from Sth Indian Division that the way now lay open
onto the Sfax plain and the enemy was in full flight. Only at 1pm did the
lead regiment cross and by nightfall had still not advanced past the infantry
positions secured by the Indian troops. The Indian troops, meanwhile, pressed
on, seizing further positions from the disorganized Italians.

The attacks elsewhere by XXX Corps began at 0330, initially silently,
although powerful artillery support was immediately on hand ready to open
fire at 0600. Fifteen field and four medium regiments were in support

attacked in the gap between 4th Indian Division and the Djebel Roumana

outpost on Point 85, but intense machine-gun, mortar and artillery fire held
up two battalions before the anti-tank ditch. A combination of a flanking
tank attack and pressure on the left by 4th Indian Division eased the
situation, however, and the anti-tank ditch was passed allowing engineers
to make a crossing and gap the minefields. By 1100, 69th Infantry Brigade
had secured its objectives and the enemy was broken in front of them. At
1225 the divisional commander reported enemy resistance in front of his

The assault mounted by two brigades of Sist Highland Division,
commanded by Maj. Gen. Wimberley, initially went well, with its leading
troops clearing the ridge of defenders dazed by a heavy bombardment,
and work on gapping the anti-tank obstacle below began. Large numbers of
surrendering Italians caused problems. Further progress, however, was halted
by fierce German counter-attacks using local reserves and tanks from 15th
Panzer Division, that steadily increased in intensity as inactive Italian positions
came to life forcing British troops back below the crest. Heavy fighting
continued all day and into the night, which for the division was the fiercest it
had encountered to date.

The pursuit phase of the Battle of Wadi Akarit was to be sadly mismanaged.
Although Tuker reported the way was clear for X Corps to advance over the
crossing it had secured, doubts as to whether the last line of hills ahead had
been cleared remained and stopped an advance, although this was later done
so by the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles. A handful of German 88mm anti-tank guns,
moreover, also remained active in the rear of the Roumana feature, holding up
a limited advance by 8th Armoured Brigade.

The 10th Corps finally passed through 4th Indian and 50th Division’s
fronts at 0700 on 7 April in the hole in the Axis defences created for them, and
renewed the attack; however, apart from men waiting to surrender the enemy
had already gone. With the main defences already in British hands and too
few troops to organize an effective counter-attack to restore its positions,
the Axis position was untenable. On the night of 6 April AOK disengaged
and pulled out, with its withdrawal skilfully covered by a series of local
counter-attacks.

‘The Battle of Wadi Akarit was a remarkable achievement for Eighth Army.
A daring surprise night attack had mauled and quickly put to flight enemy
troops, including elements of six infantry divisions and three armoured
divisions - albeit all weak - from a naturally strong position located in largely
difficult mountainous terrain. It was a tribute to the high state of training
and skill of Commonwealth infantry in Eighth Army, especially those in 4th
Indian Division. Fortunately the ‘butcher's bill’ had been light. Eighth Army
suffered 1,289 casualties in total and lost 32 tanks, but it had taken 7,000
(mostly Italian) prisoners. Losses in Axis guns had been heavy. Perhaps most
disappointing was that Eighth Army yet again had failed to finish the enemy
off by mounting an effective pursuit using X Corps, despite arguably having
had the best opportunity to do so to date.
