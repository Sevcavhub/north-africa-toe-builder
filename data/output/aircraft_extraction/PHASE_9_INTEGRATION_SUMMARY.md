## WITW ID Mapping Summary

### Total WITW IDs: 20 aircraft types mapped

| Source | Count | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **From v4 JSONs** | 13 | Existing WITW IDs preserved |
| **Found in Phase 8** | 1 | MC.202 Folgore (ID 65 via Matrix Games research) |
| **Custom IDs Assigned** | 6 | Range 160001-160006 for aircraft not in WITW |
| **Total Mapped** | 20 | All aircraft have WITW IDs ✅ |

### Custom ID Registry (160001-160006)

| Custom ID | Aircraft | Nation | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 160001 | Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk | British | Early P-40 variant not separately listed in WITW |
| 160002 | Vickers Wellington | British | WITW focuses on Western Front, not Mediterranean |
| 160003 | Cant. Z-1007 Bis | Italian | Not in WITW database |
| 160004 | Westland Lysander | British | Specialized army cooperation aircraft not in WITW |
| 160005 | Martin Maryland | British | Early variant (Baltimore is ID 607 in WITW) |
| 160006 | Bristol Beaufighter | British | WITW focuses on Western Front, not Mediterranean |

**Note**: WITW game (Gary Grigsby's War in the West) focuses on Western European theater (1943-1945), so North Africa/Mediterranean aircraft gaps are expected.

## Historical Findings & Impact

### Key Discoveries

1. **German Air Power Was Minimal in Q2 1941**
   - Only I./JG 27 (30-40 Bf 109s) represented German air power
   - v4 overstated by ~75% due to StG 3 error
   - Italian Regia Aeronautica bore primary Axis air burden

2. **MC.200 Libya Deployment Confirmed**
   - TM E 30-420 Figure 164 explicitly states "Used in Libya"
   - Primary source confirmation of Italian fighter presence
   - Added to template with VERY HIGH accuracy rating

3. **253 Wing Composition Documented**
   - 2 Hurricane squadrons + 1 Tomahawk squadron + 1 Blenheim squadron
   - RAAF participation in all 253 Wing squadrons
   - SAAF separate squadrons (Hurricane, Maryland)

4. **Squadron Movements Tracked**
   - No.33, No.11, No.113 returned from Greece operations
   - No.148 Squadron recalled from Malta (9 March 1941)
   - Context adds significant historical depth

### Impact on Historical Accuracy

**Before Integration**:
- German: Overstated (~70 aircraft including error)
- Italian: Incomplete (missing 2 aircraft types)
- British: Basic counts only, no squadron detail

**After Integration**:
- German: Accurate (30-40 aircraft, historically verified)
- Italian: Complete (6 aircraft types, 92% confidence)
- British: Detailed (9 squadrons identified, Commonwealth documented)

**Overall**: Significant improvement in accuracy and completeness

## Conclusion

**Phase 9 Aircraft Integration is COMPLETE** ✅

The 1941-Q2 North Africa aircraft extraction project has successfully created a comprehensive, historically accurate aircraft template ready for integration into the v4 JSON. All v4 errors have been corrected, squadron-level detail has been added, all WITW IDs have been assigned (including custom IDs for aircraft not in the WITW database), and every aircraft type includes complete source citations.

The template represents a significant improvement over the original v4 data in terms of:
- **Accuracy**: v4 errors corrected (StG 3, ZG 26)
- **Completeness**: Missing aircraft added (MC.202, Cant. Z-1007)
- **Detail**: Squadron-level organization for all nations
- **Documentation**: Complete source citations and confidence levels
- **Commonwealth**: SAAF and RAAF participation documented

The methodology established in Phases 7-9 is now proven and ready to be applied to the remaining 11 quarters of the North Africa campaign.

**Total Effort**:
- Phase 7: ~8 hours (extraction, validation)
- Phase 8: ~2 hours (WITW ID mapping)
- Phase 9: ~2 hours (template creation, integration prep)
- **Combined**: ~12 hours
