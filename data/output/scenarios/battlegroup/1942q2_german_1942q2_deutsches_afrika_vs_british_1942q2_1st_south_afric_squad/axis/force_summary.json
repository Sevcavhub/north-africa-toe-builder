Extended supply lines from Tripoli (800km) and Benghazi (recaptured Jan 1942, now operational as forward port - 350km). British naval/air interdiction from Malta remains 25-35% convoy loss rate. Q2 1942 preparations: Fuel reserves 7-8 days (improved from Q1's crisis 5-6 days), ammunition 11-12 days, water 12-15L/man/day. Rommel accumulated supplies April-May for Gazala offensive scheduled 26 May 1942. Critical supply issue: British Grant tanks arriving Egypt (75mm gun outmatches all German tanks except Panzer IV F2). Supply base: Tripoli (main port) + Benghazi (forward port, critical for Gazala logistics). Rommel's gamble: Attack before British 8th Army fully equipped with Grants.",
