## Deployment

**Defender**: British forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Northern Tunisia hill country and mountain ranges. Terrain features: steep hills (djebels) with narrow valleys, limited all-weather road network, easily defended high ground. Extensive olive groves and agricultural areas (unlike Western Desert). Rivers and wadis prone to flooding during winter rains. Terrain heavily favors defenders - German forces hold key heights dominating valleys and supply routes. Much more restrictive than Western Desert - armor employment limited to valleys and roads.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules

- Limited Fuel: Vehicles move at half speed after Turn 5
- Desert Conditions: Visibility 48" maximum, dust after vehicle movement

## Supply & Environment

**Fuel**: Unknown days
**Ammunition**: Unknown days
