  "terrain": "Northern and central Tunisia - highly varied terrain. Coastal plains (Tunis, Bizerte area) suitable for mechanized operations. Eastern Dorsal mountain range (Fa√Ød Pass, Kasserine Pass, Sbiba Pass) creates natural defensive barrier - rocky mountains up to 1,000-1,500m elevation with limited pass roads. Central plateau region between mountains and coast - mixed agricultural land and rocky hills. Wadis (dry riverbeds) throughout - flash flood hazards during winter rains. More compartmentalized terrain than Libyan open desert - limits maneuver warfare, favors defensive operations.",
