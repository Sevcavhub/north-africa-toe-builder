    "supply_status": "CRITICAL - Army operating under severe constraints. Allied naval/air interdiction of Mediterranean convoys prevents adequate resupply from Sicily/Italy. Tunisia ports (Tunis, Bizerte, Sfax) operational but under constant Allied air attack. Axis shipping losses catastrophic: January-March 1943 approximately 40-50% of supply ships/aircraft lost in transit. Fuel situation most critical constraint - limits mobile operations to defensive counterattacks only. Ammunition adequate for defensive combat but insufficient for sustained offensive. No heavy equipment replacement capability - every tank/vehicle loss permanent. Personnel reinforcements limited - approximately 5,000-8,000 replacements arrived Q1 vs 12,000-15,000 casualties. Strategic supply situation hopeless - Tunisia bridgehead unsustainable without Mediterranean control.",
