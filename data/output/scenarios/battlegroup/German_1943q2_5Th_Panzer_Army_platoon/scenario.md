## Deployment

**Defender**: German forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Cap Bon peninsula and northern Tunisia final defensive perimeter. Mountainous terrain with coastal plains. Djebel Abderrahman mountains (800-1,000m elevation) provide natural defensive barrier. Coastal plains suitable for mechanized operations (favors Allied armor superiority). Numerous wadis, olive groves, agricultural villages create compartmented terrain. Final perimeter centered on Tunis-Bizerte area compressed to Cap Bon peninsula (30km x 40km) by May 8. Restrictive terrain limits maneuver but also restricts Allied flanking movements - forces frontal assaults. Tunis urban area (population ~200,000) falls May 7 - street fighting avoided as German forces withdraw to peninsula. Cap Bon peninsula rocky hills and coastal lowlands - limited water sources (springs, wells adequate). Terrain favors defense but immobile defense without fuel/vehicles = death trap vs Allied mobility.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules
