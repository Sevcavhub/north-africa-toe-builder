    "supply_status": "Rebuilding after Operation Battleaxe losses (June 1941). Tank replacements arriving through Q3. Fuel and ammunition adequate for defensive operations but constrained for major offensives. Water supply prioritized due to summer heat. British logistics more robust than Axis due to shorter supply lines from Egypt.",
    "notes": "Shorter supply lines from Egyptian depots (Alexandria, Cairo) compared to Axis forces. Forward supply dumps at Maaten Bagush and Sidi Barrani. Water consumption higher in Q3 summer heat."
