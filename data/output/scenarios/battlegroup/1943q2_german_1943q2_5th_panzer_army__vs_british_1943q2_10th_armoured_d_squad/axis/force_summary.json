    "supply_status": "TOTAL COLLAPSE - Army completely cut off from resupply April 20 onward. Allied naval blockade and air supremacy prevent any shipping from Sicily/Italy. Tunisia ports (Tunis, Bizerte) fall to Allies May 7. Air bridge from Sicily shut down May 5 after catastrophic transport losses (100+ Ju-52 transports destroyed attempting supply flights). NO fuel deliveries after April 25. NO ammunition deliveries after April 30. NO food deliveries after May 5. Army consuming stockpiled reserves April 1-25, then complete exhaustion. Fuel completely gone May 8-10. Artillery ammunition exhausted May 10-12. Small arms ammunition rationed to 10 rounds/soldier final days. No medical supplies - field hospitals overwhelmed, no anesthetics, no bandages. Water adequate (northern Tunisia wells, spring rainfall). Starvation imminent by May 13 - surrender partly motivated by food exhaustion. Strategic situation: 230,000 Axis troops (German+Italian) trapped in 50km x 80km pocket with zero resupply. Hitler refused evacuation (unlike Dunkirk 1940 or later evacuations). Complete destruction inevitable - only question was timing of surrender.",
