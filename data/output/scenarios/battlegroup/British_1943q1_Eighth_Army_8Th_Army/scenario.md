## Deployment

**Defender**: British forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Southern Tunisia - Mareth Line sector and approaches. Mixed terrain: coastal plain (Mareth positions), rocky hills and plateau (Matmata Hills - 4th Indian Division sector), narrow mountain passes (Tebaga Gap - X Corps Left Hook route), wadis (Wadi Zigzaoug anti-tank obstacle at Mareth). Significantly more varied and restrictive than Western Desert open terrain. Extensive Axis fortifications, minefields, and defensive positions. Better roads and more vegetation than Libya. Terrain channelizes movement - favors defenders, limits armoured maneuver to predictable routes.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules

- Limited Fuel: Vehicles move at half speed after Turn 5
- Desert Conditions: Visibility 48" maximum, dust after vehicle movement

## Supply & Environment
