British naval interdiction (Malta-based RAF/RN) destroys 30-40% of Axis convoys. Fuel reserves 5 days (same as DAK critical shortage), ammunition 8 days, water 11L/man/day (barely adequate desert minimum). DAK convoy arrived 5 Jan 1942 (55 tanks total enabling counter-offensive). Division share: ~25 tanks. Supply base: Tripoli port with forward dump at Benghazi recaptured 29 Jan 1942 (critical port). Capture of British supply dumps at Agedabia/Benghazi essential for sustained operations. Division logistics rebuilt after Crusader but still strained.",
