## Deployment

**Defender**: British forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Southern Tunisia (April-May): Wadi Akarit defensive line sector - coastal plains, wadis, anti-tank ditches, rocky hills (Djebel Roumana, Djebel Fatnassa), and Axis fortifications. Enfidaville sector (late April-May): hilly terrain limiting armoured operations. Post-May 13: Tunisian coast and hinterland for rest/refit and amphibious training. More varied terrain than Western Desert with better water availability, agricultural areas, and road network. Tunisia terrain favored defenders with hills commanding valleys, limited approach routes, and prepared defensive positions.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules

- Limited Fuel: Vehicles move at half speed after Turn 5
- Desert Conditions: Visibility 48" maximum, dust after vehicle movement
