## Deployment

**Defender**: German forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Northern and central Tunisia - highly varied terrain. Coastal plains (Tunis, Bizerte area) suitable for mechanized operations. Eastern Dorsal mountain range (Faïd Pass, Kasserine Pass, Sbiba Pass) creates natural defensive barrier - rocky mountains up to 1,000-1,500m elevation with limited pass roads. Central plateau region between mountains and coast - mixed agricultural land and rocky hills. Wadis (dry riverbeds) throughout - flash flood hazards during winter rains. More compartmentalized terrain than Libyan open desert - limits maneuver warfare, favors defensive operations.

## Special Rules
