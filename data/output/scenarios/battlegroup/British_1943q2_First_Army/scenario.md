## Deployment

**Defender**: British forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Northern Tunisia: Tebourba-Medjez el Bab-Tunis sector. Medjerda Valley (relatively flat agricultural land with river) providing main axis of advance, surrounded by rugged hills and djebels (steep heights). Limited road network channeling movement. Defensive terrain favoring Axis defenders until final Allied offensive. Mountain terrain requiring infantry-led assaults. Coastal plains near Tunis and Bizerte. Agricultural land providing some cover but restricting vehicle movement. Rocky hills requiring infantry assaults with armor support limited to valleys. First Army operations concentrated in northern Tunisia hill country contrasting with Eighth Army's southern desert approaches.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules

- Limited Fuel: Vehicles move at half speed after Turn 5
- Desert Conditions: Visibility 48" maximum, dust after vehicle movement
