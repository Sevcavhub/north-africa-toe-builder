## Deployment

**Defender**: Italian forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: El Alamein defensive line - northern sector of XXI Corps area, adjacent to Brescia Division and supporting German Ramcke Parachute Brigade. Defensive positions in rocky desert with shallow trenches (hard ground limited digging depth), extensive Italian/German minefields, wire obstacles. Terrain offers minimal natural cover - troops exposed to British artillery bombardment and RAF bombing. Post-Second El Alamein (November 4+): survivors retreating on foot across open desert - catastrophic for non-motorized infantry lacking vehicles, water, or supplies.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules

- Limited Fuel: Vehicles move at half speed after Turn 5
- Desert Conditions: Visibility 48" maximum, dust after vehicle movement
