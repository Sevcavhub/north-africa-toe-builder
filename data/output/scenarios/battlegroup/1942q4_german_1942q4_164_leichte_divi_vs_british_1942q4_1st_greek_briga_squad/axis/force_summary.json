    "supply_status": "Critical shortage across all categories. Fuel and ammunition most critical. Division's supply situation mirrors overall Panzerarmee Afrika crisis during El Alamein period. British interdiction of supply convoys from Italy and bombing of Tobruk/Benghazi ports created chronic shortages. By November retreat, division operating on captured British supplies and salvage.",
    "notes": "Fuel situation most critical factor limiting operations. Artillery ammunition rationed to 10-15 rounds per gun per day during El Alamein battle. Small arms ammunition adequate but resupply difficult. Food situation better than fuel/ammunition but convoy losses reduced reserves. Supply route via Tobruk and coastal road from Benghazi constantly interdicted by RAF and Royal Navy."
