## Historical Situation

2nd CCNN Division '28 Ottobre' was one of four Blackshirt (Camicie Nere) divisions deployed to North Africa. Named after the March on Rome (October 28, 1922). The division participated in the Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940), advancing to Sidi Barrani. Following British Operation Compass (December 9, 1940), the division retreated to Bardia fortress where it would make its final stand alongside the 1st CCNN Division '23 Marzo'. This snapshot shows the division in late December 1940, preparing defensive positions before the British/Australian assault that would destroy the division in early January 1941.
