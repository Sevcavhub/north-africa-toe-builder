## Deployment

**Defender**: German forces deploy first, within 18" of table edge

**Attacker**: Opponent deploys within 12" of opposite edge

**Terrain**: Northern and central Tunisia - highly varied terrain. Coastal plains (Tunis, Bizerte area) suitable for mechanized operations. Eastern Dorsal mountain range (Fa誰d Pass, Kasserine Pass, Sbiba Pass) creates natural defensive barrier - rocky mountains up to 1,000-1,500m elevation with limited pass roads. Central plateau region between mountains and coast - mixed agricultural land and rocky hills. Wadis (dry riverbeds) throughout - flash flood hazards during winter rains. More compartmentalized terrain than Libyan open desert - limits maneuver warfare, favors defensive operations.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Break enemy Battlegroup Rating (BR)

**Secondary**:
- Hold 2 of 3 objectives
- Destroy enemy command unit
- Take fewer casualties than opponent

## Special Rules

- Limited Fuel: Vehicles move at half speed after Turn 5
- Desert Conditions: Visibility 48" maximum, dust after vehicle movement
