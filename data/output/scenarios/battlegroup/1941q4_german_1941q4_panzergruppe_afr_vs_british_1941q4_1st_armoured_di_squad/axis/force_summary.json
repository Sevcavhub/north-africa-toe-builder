    "supply_status": "CRITICAL - Chronic and worsening supply crisis during Q4 1941, culminating in catastrophic logistics breakdown during Operation Crusader (November 18 - December 20). Primary constraints: (1) Distance from Tripoli supply port (1,800km), (2) British interdiction of Mediterranean convoys (November: 62% of supplies sunk en route), (3) Limited port capacity at Benghazi (damaged by RAF), (4) British air superiority disrupting desert supply columns, (5) Fuel exhaustion during intense mobile operations November-December. Result: Forced withdrawal from Cyrenaica to El Agheila (December 15), abandoning Tobruk siege after 231 days. Supply situation at end Q4: Fuel reserves critically low (3.8 days average across formations), ammunition barely adequate for defensive operations only (6 days), water supply strained due to tanker losses. Italian XX Corps suffered complete logistics collapse (1.5 days fuel, forced to abandon vehicles). Rommel's repeated requests for reinforcements and supplies mostly unfulfilled due to OKH prioritization of Eastern Front. End-Q4 status: Panzergruppe can conduct static defense only, no offensive operations possible until supply situation improves Q1 1942.",
    "notes": "Operational radius collapsed from 350km (Q3) to 220km (end Q4) due to vehicle losses and fuel crisis. Fuel reserves represent weighted average across formations: DAK 6.5 days, XX Corps 1.5 days, XXI Corps 3.5 days = ~3.8 days Panzergruppe average. Water consumption 4.2L/person/day adequate for cooler Q4 temperatures (vs 5L+ in Q3 summer heat). Supply crisis forced Rommel to abandon offensive operations and retreat 600km from Tobruk to El Agheila, losing all territorial gains from 1941 spring offensive. November convoy disaster: 7 ships sunk (62% of monthly tonnage), only 30% of required fuel/ammunition delivered."
