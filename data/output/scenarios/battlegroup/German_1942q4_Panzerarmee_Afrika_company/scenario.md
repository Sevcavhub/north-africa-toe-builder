**Terrain**: Coastal desert (El Alamein to Tunisia): Hard-packed gravel plains, soft sand areas (vehicle traps), coastal salt marshes (impassable). El Alamein line: anchored north on Mediterranean coast, south on Qattara Depression (impassable salt marsh 130m below sea level). Minimal natural cover forced extensive fortification. Via Balbia coastal road primary route (single-track in places, bottleneck during retreat). Western Desert: open tank country but fuel shortage negated mobility advantage. Cyrenaica plateau: escarpments, wadis channelized movement. Tunisian mountains/hills: different terrain, restricted maneuver vs open desert.
