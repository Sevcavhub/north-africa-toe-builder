Chronic fuel shortages constraining all mobile operations. DAK had only 3 days fuel for sustained combat during Battle of Alam Halfa (30 Aug - 5 Sept). Ammunition adequate but declining. Reliance on captured British vehicles and supplies critical for continued operations. Water rationing at 2.5-3 liters per man per day.",
