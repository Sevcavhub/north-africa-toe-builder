      "environmental_challenges": "Water scarcity: All water transported from Mersa Matruh - no local sources. Determined operational tempo as much as fuel/ammunition. Sand/dust infiltration: Constant weapon/vehicle maintenance required. Rifles cleaned 2-3x daily. Vehicle air filters changed/cleaned twice daily. Navigation difficult: Featureless terrain, few landmarks. Night approach march to Nibeiwa (8-9 Dec) required precise compass navigation. Limited cover: Open desert provided virtually no concealment. Dust clouds from vehicles visible for miles. Health issues: Desert sores from sand/flies. Dysentery from poor field hygiene. Eye problems from dust/glare. Division medical services maintained strict sanitation procedures."
