    "objectives": "Combined German-Italian Panzer Army Group conducting mobile armored warfare and siege operations in North Africa. Mission: Capture Tobruk fortress, defeat British Eighth Army in Western Desert, advance to Suez Canal. Q4 1941 reality: Defensive operations during British Operation Crusader offensive (November 18 - December 20), followed by forced withdrawal to El Agheila (December 15). Panzergruppe Afrika commanded three corps: DAK (German armored striking force), XX Corps (Italian mobile armored/motorized), XXI Corps (Italian static infantry). Rommel exercised operational control over Italian formations from 24 November 1941 despite formal Italian command structure under Comando Supremo. Strategic context: Understrength relative to British Eighth Army, chronic supply crisis due to Mediterranean interdiction, no strategic reserve, competing for resources with Eastern Front (Operation Barbarossa). End Q4 status: Tobruk siege failed, territorial losses severe (withdrew from Cyrenaica), but Panzergruppe escaped destruction and held defensive line at El Agheila-Mersa Brega.",
