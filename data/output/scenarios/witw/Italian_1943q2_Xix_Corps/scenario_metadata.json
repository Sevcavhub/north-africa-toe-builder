Main challenges: dust clouds from massive Allied vehicle movements revealing positions, increasing heat affecting North African troops, battle debris and extensive Axis minefields in former defensive zones requiring engineer clearance, urban warfare challenges in final battles for Tunis (street fighting, civilian evacuations), malaria risk increasing in coastal lowlands as temperatures rose. French colonial troops' familiarity with North African terrain was tactical advantage."
