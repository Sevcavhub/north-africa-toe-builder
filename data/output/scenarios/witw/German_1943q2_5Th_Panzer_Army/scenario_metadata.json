Restrictive terrain limits maneuver but also restricts Allied flanking movements - forces frontal assaults. Tunis urban area (population ~200,000) falls May 7 - street fighting avoided as German forces withdraw to peninsula.

Heat stress increasing for troops in defensive positions without adequate water transport (wells only). Daylight hours increasing April (12.5 hours) to May (13.5 hours) to June (14+ hours) - extended daylight favors Allied air operations. Weather generally clear April-May - excellent flying conditions = continuous Allied air attacks. German nighttime movement still viable but Allied night fighters increasingly active. Terrain conditions improving for mechanized operations vs Q1 mud - favors Allied armor superiority. Environmental impact on final collapse: Clear weather enables Allied air supremacy to devastate German positions. Extended daylight restricts German movement to 8-10 hours/night vs 12-14 hours Q1. Rising temperatures increase water demand but German truck losses prevent adequate water distribution to forward positions (rely on local wells). Overall: Weather conditions favor Allied operations, compound German supply disadvantages.",
