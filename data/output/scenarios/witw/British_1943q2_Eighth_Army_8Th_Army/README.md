Advance and neutralize Axis defensive positions.

## Supply States

- **Ammunition**: 0 days
- **Water**: 0 liters/day

## Weather & Environment

- **Terrain**: Southern Tunisia (April-May): Wadi Akarit defensive line sector - coastal plains, wadis, anti-tank ditches, rocky hills (Djebel Roumana, Djebel Fatnassa), and Axis fortifications. Enfidaville sector (late April-May): hilly terrain limiting armoured operations. Post-May 13: Tunisian coast and hinterland for rest/refit and amphibious training. More varied terrain than Western Desert with better water availability, agricultural areas, and road network. Tunisia terrain favored defenders with hills commanding valleys, limited approach routes, and prepared defensive positions.
- **Temperature**: Unknown
- **Visibility**: Clear
- **Challenges**: Wadi Akarit anti-tank ditch - major obstacle requiring engineer breaching operations (April 5-6), Hilly terrain channeling movement into predictable valleys - Axis defensive advantage, Rocky hills (Djebels) required infantry assaults - armor support limited to valleys, Limited road network - few all-weather routes, easily blocked by defenders, Dust from vehicle movement and artillery fire affecting visibility during operations, Heat stress increasing through May during final offensive operations, Water requirements significant for army operations in spring heat (adequate from coastal wells), Agricultural areas providing cover but also obstacles to cross-country movement, Enfidaville sector (late April-May): very hilly terrain limiting Eighth Army offensive operations, First Army-Eighth Army coordination: separate supply chains, operational boundaries, communications, Tunisia more populated than desert - civilian considerations, requisitioning constraints, Post-May 13: Transition from desert/Tunisia warfare to amphibious operations training, Mediterranean sea conditions for amphibious training (June preparation for Sicily), Sicily preparation: beach assault tactics, landing craft exercises, combined operations training
