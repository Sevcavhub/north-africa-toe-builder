    "objectives": "Eighth Army Q2 1943: Final North Africa offensive operations culminating in Tunisia Campaign victory, then reorganization for Sicily invasion. Primary mission April-May: Break through Axis Wadi Akarit defensive line (5-6 April), coordinate with First Army advancing from west for pincer movement, complete destruction of Axis forces in North Africa. Post-13 May: Prepare for Operation Husky (Sicily invasion, 10 July 1943). Montgomery's operational approach Q2: methodical planning, overwhelming artillery firepower (456 guns at Wadi Akarit), infantry-led breakthrough operations. Wadi Akarit assault exemplified doctrine: multi-divisional infantry assault (XXX Corps three divisions) with massive artillery support, combined arms coordination (infantry-artillery-engineers), exploitation of breakthrough. Result: Strategic success - Axis withdrawal to Enfidaville, Tunisia Campaign conclusion 13 May (250,000 prisoners). Eighth Army demonstrated operational maturity: flexible command, corps-level coordination with First Army, successful transition from desert to amphibious warfare.",
