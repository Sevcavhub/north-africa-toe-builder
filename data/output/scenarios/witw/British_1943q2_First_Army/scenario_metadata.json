Coalition army (British, American, French) under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson operating northern Tunisia sector. Mission: Coordinate multi-national offensive to capture Tunis and Bizerte, envelop Axis forces, and force unconditional surrender ending North Africa campaign. First Army executed coordinated corps-level attacks with massive artillery support, combined arms operations, and methodical reduction of German/Italian defensive positions in restrictive hill terrain. Final offensive 5-13 May 1943 resulted in British entry to Tunis (7 May), US capture of Bizerte, and complete Axis surrender (13 May, 240,000+ POWs). First Army dissolved after Tunisia victory with divisions transferred to Eighth Army for Sicily invasion or withdrawn for rest/refit.",
