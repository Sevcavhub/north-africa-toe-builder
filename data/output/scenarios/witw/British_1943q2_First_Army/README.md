## Weather & Environment

- **Terrain**: Northern Tunisia: Tebourba-Medjez el Bab-Tunis sector. Medjerda Valley (relatively flat agricultural land with river) providing main axis of advance, surrounded by rugged hills and djebels (steep heights). Limited road network channeling movement. Defensive terrain favoring Axis defenders until final Allied offensive. Mountain terrain requiring infantry-led assaults. Coastal plains near Tunis and Bizerte. Agricultural land providing some cover but restricting vehicle movement. Rocky hills requiring infantry assaults with armor support limited to valleys. First Army operations concentrated in northern Tunisia hill country contrasting with Eighth Army's southern desert approaches.
- **Temperature**: Unknown
- **Visibility**: Clear
- **Challenges**: Hilly terrain channeling movement into predictable valleys - Axis defensive advantage, Limited road network - few all-weather routes, easily blocked by defenders, Medjerda Valley key axis of advance but well-defended German positions, Djebel heights required infantry assaults - armor support limited to valleys, Dust from vehicle movement and artillery fire affecting visibility, Heat stress increasing through May (peak combat operations), Water requirements significant for coalition army (British, American, French forces), Agricultural areas sometimes providing cover, sometimes obstacle to movement, Contrast with Eighth Army's desert expertise - First Army adapted to mountain/hill warfare, Coalition coordination challenges across varied national logistics and operational methods
