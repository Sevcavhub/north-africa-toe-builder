    "objectives": "Division held in reserve at Sidi Barrani, 12 miles inland from coast. Intended as mobile reserve for Italian 10th Army's defensive positions but immobilized by fuel shortages. Static defense role due to lack of transport and mechanization. Positioned to support Libyan Corps (1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions) in fortified camps.",

British naval supremacy prevented sea resupply. Dust and sand continued to damage weapons and vehicles. Poor drainage in fortified positions during rain."
