Primary role Q2 1942: defensive operations along 25-mile sector of Gazala Line (February-May), then defensive combat during Rommel's offensive (26 May - 14 June). Division split between main line positions (69th and 151st Brigades) and isolated southern box (150th Brigade). Suffered catastrophic loss of 150th Brigade (1 June) including entire brigade (~4,500 men), 90th Field Regiment RA (24 guns), and attached engineers. Remainder withdrew to Mersa Matruh late June with 69th and 151st Brigades. Despite losses, division continued operations through First El Alamein (July) and Tunisia Campaign.",

Dust from intense mechanized combat obscured observation and degraded equipment.",

Open desert terrain in 150th Brigade sector provided minimal cover against concentrated Axis armor and air attacks. Dust and sand degraded vehicle and weapon reliability during prolonged combat. Lack of cover made defensive positions vulnerable to artillery and bombing. 150th Brigade box perimeter (20 miles) proved too large to defend effectively against concentrated armor assault."
