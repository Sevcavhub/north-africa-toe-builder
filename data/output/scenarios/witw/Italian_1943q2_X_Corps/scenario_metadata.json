Primary mission: defend Enfidaville Line against British Eighth Army final offensive. Corps completely surrounded in Tunisia pocket with no escape routes. Secondary role: delay Allied final offensive to buy time for evacuation attempts (which ultimately failed). Corps integrated into First Italian Army (1a Armata) under Marshal Giovanni Messe. This was the final quarter of X Corps existence before mass surrender on May 13, 1943.",
