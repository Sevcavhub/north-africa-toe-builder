Mission: Advance eastward from Algeria through northern Tunisia to capture Tunis and Bizerta, crushing Axis forces between First Army (north) and Eighth Army (south). Q1 1943 operations: Defensive consolidation after failed 'Run for Tunis' (November-December 1942), defensive victory against German Operation Ochsenkopf counterattack (February-March 1943), build-up phase for final offensive (Operation Vulcan, April-May 1943). First Army faces difficult terrain (mountains, narrow valleys), extended supply lines (250-400km from ports), heavy winter rains creating mud, and coalition coordination challenges (British-American-French friction).",
