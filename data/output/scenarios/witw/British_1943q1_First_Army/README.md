Extensive olive groves and agricultural areas (unlike Western Desert). Rivers and wadis prone to flooding during winter rains. Terrain heavily favors defenders - German forces hold key heights dominating valleys and supply routes. Much more restrictive than Western Desert - armor employment limited to valleys and roads.
- **Temperature**: Unknown
- **Visibility**: Clear
- **Challenges**: Mud - roads and tracks impassable during January-February rains, limiting mobility and supply, Mountainous terrain - restricts armor to valleys, favors infantry and artillery operations, Limited road network - few all-weather roads, easily blocked by German defenses and demolitions, River crossings - wadis flooded during rains, bridges critical chokepoints subject to German artillery, Extended supply lines - 250-400km from Algiers/Bone through mountains to front lines, Cold wet weather - health issues (trench foot, respiratory infections, low morale), Limited observation - hilly terrain creates dead zones for artillery fire control, German defensive positions - enemy holds key heights (Longstop Hill, Green Hill, Bald Hill), Coalition coordination - British, American, French forces with different equipment, doctrine, languages
