Unique command arrangement: French corps nominally under Italian First Army tactical command in early 1943 Tunisia, reflecting complex post-Torch Allied politics. Primary mission: defend central Tunisia sector (Eastern Dorsal, Ousseltia Valley, Fondouk Gap) against German counteroffensives while Allied forces built up strength. Secondary role: support British First Army and US II Corps operations. By March 1943, corps transferred to French command under Général Juin as senior French commander North Africa.",
