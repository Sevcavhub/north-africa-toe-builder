The division had retreated from Sidi Barrani to Bardia fortress in December 1940 during Operation Compass. At Bardia, the division defended the northern 'Gerfah' sector alongside the 1st CCNN Division '23 Marzo' (central sector) and elements of the 62nd Infantry Division 'Marmarica'. Australian 6th Division (Major General Iven Mackay) with 7th RTR Matilda II tanks assaulted the fortress on January 3rd. After fierce fighting, the fortress fell on January 5th with the division completely destroyed - personnel killed or captured. General Francesco Argentino captured. Division NEVER REFORMED - one of four CCNN divisions destroyed in Cyrenaica 1940-41 and permanently disbanded. This snapshot represents the division's final hours before complete destruction.",
