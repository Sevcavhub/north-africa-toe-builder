Via Balbia coastal road primary route (single-track in places, bottleneck during retreat). Western Desert: open tank country but fuel shortage negated mobility advantage. Cyrenaica plateau: escarpments, wadis channelized movement. Tunisian mountains/hills: different terrain, restricted maneuver vs open desert.
