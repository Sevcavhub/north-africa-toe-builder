Primary role Q2 1942: defensive operations along coastal sector of Gazala Line (April-May), then fighting withdrawal during Battle of Gazala (26 May - 14 June). First quarter with full 3-brigade strength (3rd Brigade transferred from 2nd SA Division on 21 March). Successfully defended positions against Italian Sabratha Division breakthrough attempt. Conducted orderly withdrawal along coastal road to Mersa Matruh without catastrophic losses (unlike 2nd SA Division at Tobruk).",
