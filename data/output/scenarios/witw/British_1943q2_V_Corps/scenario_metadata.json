V Corps (three infantry divisions plus attached armor) operated in northern Tunisia Tebourba-Medjez el Bab sector, advancing eastward along Medjerda Valley toward Tunis. Mission: Break through Axis defensive positions, seize key terrain (djebels), advance to Tunis, and coordinate with other First Army corps for final envelopment of Axis forces. Corps executed set-piece attacks with massive artillery support, combined infantry-armor operations, and methodical reduction of German defensive positions. Final offensive 6-13 May 1943 resulted in British entry to Tunis (7 May) and complete Axis surrender (13 May, 240,000 POWs).",
