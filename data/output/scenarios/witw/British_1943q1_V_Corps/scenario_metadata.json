Operations focused on seizing key terrain (djebels) dominating valleys and roads. Limited by terrain, weather, and logistics during Q1 1943 - offensive operations constrained to February's Operation Ochsenkopf (German counterattack, defended successfully) and March preparations for spring offensive. Corps held defensive positions during worst winter weather (January-February), then prepared for April offensive operations.",
