Mission: hold assigned defensive sector against anticipated major British offensive (Second Battle of El Alamein, October 23-November 4, 1942). Division positioned adjacent to Brescia Division, supporting German Ramcke Parachute Brigade. Expected to conduct positional defense in prepared positions with minefields. ZERO offensive capability - division exhausted, depleted, lacking vehicles, fuel, ammunition, and water. Division's final role: cannon fodder in hopeless defensive battle against overwhelming British Commonwealth material and numerical superiority.",
