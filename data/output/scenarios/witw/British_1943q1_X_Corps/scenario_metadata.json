    "objectives": "X Corps functioned as Eighth Army's armoured reserve and exploitation force during Q1 1943 Tunisia operations. Primary mission: provide mobile striking power for Montgomery's Mareth Line assault. Corps executed complex command arrangement: HQ staff seconded to New Zealand Corps to provide adequate headquarters personnel for reinforced 2nd NZ Division. On 23 March, Montgomery ordered Horrocks and X Corps HQ to take control of Tebaga Gap operations, coordinating 1st Armoured Division (reinforcing from reserve), 7th Armoured Division (transferred from XXX Corps), and New Zealand Corps for 'Left Hook' outflanking maneuver. This flexible command structure allowed Montgomery to concentrate armoured divisions for decisive breakthrough while XXX Corps conducted frontal assault pinning German reserves.",
