British Field Army deployed in North Africa during 1943Q1.

## Supply States

- **Fuel**: 8.75 days
- **Ammunition**: 0 days
- **Water**: 0 liters/day
- **Supply Status**: unknown

## Weather & Environment

- **Terrain**: Southern Tunisia - Mareth Line sector and approaches. Mixed terrain: coastal plain (Mareth positions), rocky hills and plateau (Matmata Hills - 4th Indian Division sector), narrow mountain passes (Tebaga Gap - X Corps Left Hook route), wadis (Wadi Zigzaoug anti-tank obstacle at Mareth). Significantly more varied and restrictive than Western Desert open terrain. Extensive Axis fortifications, minefields, and defensive positions. Better roads and more vegetation than Libya. Terrain channelizes movement - favors defenders, limits armoured maneuver to predictable routes.
- **Temperature**: Unknown
- **Visibility**: Clear
- **Challenges**: Extended supply lines 600-800km from Tripoli - manageable but constrain operational radius, Mareth Line heavily fortified - Axis defensive positions learned from El Alamein lessons, Wadi Zigzaoug anti-tank ditch - major obstacle for XXX Corps frontal assault, Extensive minefields at Mareth Line and key approaches - required engineer clearance, Tebaga Gap bottleneck - narrow pass restricted X Corps maneuver for Left Hook, Terrain favors defenders - hills command valleys, limited approach routes, Matmata Hills (4th Indian Division sector) - mountainous terrain requires specialist mountain warfare, Rocky terrain limits off-road mobility - more road-bound than desert operations, Coordination with First Army (advancing from west) - logistics and operational synchronization, Tunisia more populated than desert - civilian considerations, requisitioning constraints, Winter weather (Jan-Feb) delayed operations - Montgomery waited for ground to dry, Limited water sources away from coast - still requires water bowsers for interior operations
