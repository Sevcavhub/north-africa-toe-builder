    "objectives": "Eighth Army Q1 1943: Transition from defensive Libya operations to offensive Tunisia Campaign. Primary mission: Break through Axis Mareth Line defenses in southern Tunisia, link up with First Army advancing from west (Operation Torch), complete destruction of Axis forces in North Africa. Montgomery's operational approach: methodical planning, overwhelming force concentration, refusal to attack until logistics adequate. Mareth Line assault (19-31 March) exemplified doctrine: two-pronged offensive combining XXX Corps frontal assault (pinning German reserves) with X Corps / New Zealand Corps 'Left Hook' outflanking maneuver through Tebaga Gap. Artillery superiority (336× 25-pounders) provided massive fire support. Combined arms coordination: infantry-tank-artillery teams, engineer mine clearance, night operations. Result: Strategic success despite XXX Corps tactical failure - Axis forced to withdraw from Mareth Line. Eighth Army demonstrated operational maturity: flexible command structure, multi-corps coordination, exploitation of enemy weaknesses.",
