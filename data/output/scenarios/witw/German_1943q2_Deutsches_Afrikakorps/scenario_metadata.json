Good weather overall favored Allies with air superiority - clear skies enabled constant air attacks on Axis positions, supply lines, and retreating columns.",

Allied air superiority preventing daylight movement - dust clouds from vehicles immediately drew air strikes. Limited road network forcing predictable routes. Water sources adequate but distribution prevented by fuel crisis. Malaria in coastal areas. Terrain favored defense but overwhelming Allied material superiority and air dominance made defensive positions untenable."
