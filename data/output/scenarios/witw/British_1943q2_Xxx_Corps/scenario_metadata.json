Corps mission: Break through heavily fortified Axis defensive lines using infantry-led set-piece assaults, enabling armoured exploitation by X Corps. Q2 saw two distinct phases: (1) Combat operations: Wadi Akarit assault (5-6 April 1943) where three divisions (4th Indian, 50th, 51st Highland totaling ~50,600 men) breached Axis defensive line forcing 240km retreat to Enfidaville. (2) Reorganization phase: Mid-April onward, XXX Corps dissolved/reorganized as Eighth Army prepared for Sicily invasion. Subordinate divisions transferred to other formations or withdrawn for rest.",
