    "situation": {
      "formation": "Raised 15 July 1935 as 1st Motorized Division 'Trento'. Renumbered to 32nd Motorized Division, then 102nd Motorized Division on 2 January 1939.",
      "q1_1941_status": "Q1 1941 represents the deployment phase. Division spent January-February completing final preparations in metropolitan Italy. Deployed to Libya in March 1941 as part of Axis reinforcement following Operation Compass British victories. Arrived with 95%+ strength and full equipment allocation. By end Q1, moving into position for April operations around Tobruk.",
      "deployment_context": "Trento deployed as part of broader Axis reinforcement (including German DAK). Italian High Command sent both motorized divisions (Trento, Trieste) to North Africa to support Rommel's offensive and counter British Operation Compass successes. Trento represented one of Italy's best divisions - fully motorized, well-equipped, and trained.",
      "significance": "Trento exemplifies Italian attempt to field mobile mechanized forces comparable to German motorized divisions. While lacking organic armor and suffering equipment limitations, Trento was among Italy's most capable divisions. Q1 1941 data captures division at peak strength before combat attrition reduces effectiveness.",
      "looking_ahead": "April 16, 1941 (Q2) Tobruk assault will devastate Trento - 803 POWs captured from single regiment, plus additional casualties. Division will spend remainder 1941 conducting siege operations while reconstituting. Ultimate fate: destroyed Second Battle El Alamein, November 1942."
