❗ TOP 5 PRIORITIES FOR NEXT SESSION

 1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Enable MDBook Chapter Generation
    - Only 1 chapter exists for 107 units (0.9% compliance)
    - Configure book_chapter_generator agent in autonomous workflow
    - Generate chapters for 3 recent units as proof-of-concept
    - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours autonomous processing

 2. 🟡 HIGH: Improve 1940-Q3 Coverage
    - Current: 3 units at 52.7% confidence
    - Target: 10+ units at 75%+ confidence
    - Focus: Italian 10th Army, British defensive forces
    - Estimated effort: 5-7 hours autonomous processing

 3. 🟡 HIGH: Enhance 1940-Q2 Unit Quality
    - Current: 6 units at 63.7% confidence
    - Target: Raise to 75%+ confidence
    - Use: British Army Lists Q2 1940, Italian OOB documents
    - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours autonomous processing

 4. 🟢 MEDIUM: Clean Up Metadata Files
    - 10 files incorrectly categorized as units
    - Move orchestration_metadata.json to /metadata/
    - Update file organization structure
    - Estimated effort: 30 minutes manual work

 5. 🟢 MEDIUM: Batch Validate Equipment Totals
    - Verify tanks.total = sum(heavy + medium + light)
    - Check artillery_total >= sum(field + AT + AA)
    - Flag calculation errors
    - Estimated effort: 1 hour script + validation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Data Integrity:             ✅ PASS - Zero critical gaps, equipment totals present
Source Documentation:       ✅ PASS - Average 6-8 sources per unit
Commander Documentation:    ✅ PASS - Division commanders 95%+ documented
Equipment Inventories:      ✅ PASS - Complete with WITW IDs (99.3% coverage)

Template Compliance:        ❌ FAIL - Only 0.9% MDBook chapters generated
Scenario Export:            ❌ FAIL - No wargaming scenarios generated
Database Population:        ❌ FAIL - No SQL scripts generated

OVERALL: ✅ GOOD - Data quality excellent, output generation needs work

🎯 RECOMMENDATION: ENABLE CHAPTER GENERATION IMMEDIATELY

The project's greatest weakness is downstream output generation. While JSON data
quality is excellent (zero critical gaps, 75.7% meet threshold), only 1 MDBook
chapter exists for 107 completed units.

**Action Required:**
  1. Enable book_chapter_generator agent in autonomous workflow
  2. Test chapter generation on 3 recent units
  3. Batch-generate chapters for all 107 existing units
  4. Integrate chapter generation into standard completion pipeline

With this fix, the project will be publication-ready for MDBook deployment.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 PROJECT COMPLETION ESTIMATE

Current Progress:           107 / 213 units (50.2%)
Remaining Units:            106
Average Time per Unit:      ~4 minutes autonomous processing
Estimated Completion Time:  ~7 hours autonomous work (106 units)

With 3-5 units per session: 21-35 more autonomous sessions required

Target Completion:          Q4 2025 (achievable)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
