## Supply Status

|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 12 | Low |
| Ammunition | 22 | Adequate |
| Food | 25 | Adequate |
| Water | 48676 L/day | Minimal |

**Assessment**: Metropolitan division permanently stationed in Libya since pre-war. Well-supplied at June 1940 entry into WWII, stationed in Eastern Cyrenaica defensive sector.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Static defense of Eastern Cyrenaica sector, manning fortified positions along Egyptian border

**Special Capabilities**:
- Metropolitan division with full peacetime training
- Permanently stationed in Libya since pre-war period
- Acclimatized to desert conditions
- Familiar with local terrain and defensive positions

**Known Issues**:
- Binary structure (2 regiments) reduces combat power vs. pre-1939 ternary divisions
- Limited motor transport for mobility (non-autotrasportabile)
- Dependent on animal transport for much logistics
- Very weak anti-tank capability (only 8 x 47mm guns)
- Minimal anti-aircraft defense (only 4 x 20mm guns)
- No armored fighting vehicles organic to division
- Fascist Militia legion integration still incomplete in June 1940
- Vulnerable to mobile warfare tactics employed by British in 1940-41

**Desert Adaptations**: Long-term desert garrison, equipped with tropical uniforms, experienced in desert logistics and water management, but lacking mechanization for mobile desert operations

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 6/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Static Defense: +1 in prepared fortifications
- Desert Garrison: No penalties for desert operations
- Limited Mobility: -2 to strategic movement, primarily foot-mobile
- Weak AT Defense: -1 vs. armored attacks
- Metropolitan Status: Better trained than colonial units, +1 morale vs. colonial divisions
- Destroyed 1940-41: Division was destroyed during Operation Compass/Compass follow-on

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Western Desert 1940-Q2
- Italian entry into WWII (June 1940)
- Border operations Egypt-Libya June 1940
- Static defense scenarios Eastern Cyrenaica
- North Africa early war period
