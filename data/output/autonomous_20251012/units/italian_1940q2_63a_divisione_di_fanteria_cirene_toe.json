Division composition confirmed from USA HQ G-2 July 1943 document: 157th LIGURIA Infantry Regiment, 158th LIGURIA Infantry Regiment, 45th CIRENE Artillery Regiment (home station Lecce, Italy). Division followed standard Italian binary division structure implemented March 1940 with attached 2-battalion Fascist Militia legion. Vehicle counts estimated as lower than autotrasportabile divisions (this was a standard foot-mobile division). Artillery allocation standard for binary division: 36 field guns (24 x 75mm, 12 x 100mm). Division destroyed during Operation Compass and follow-on British offensive into Libya (December 1940 - February 1941). Confidence score 68% reflects good structural data from primary sources but missing commander identification and precise June 1940 operational details.",

The division had been stationed in Libya for extended period pre-war and was one of several metropolitan divisions defending Cyrenaica. Unlike autotrasportabile divisions (Brescia, Pavia, etc.), the Cirene was a standard binary infantry division with limited motor transport. Equipment allocations follow standard binary division tables from TM 30-420. The Fascist Militia legion (Legione CC.NN. Cirene) was theoretically attached from 1 March 1940, but integration may have been incomplete by June 1940. Division's ultimate fate (destruction in 1940-41) is well-documented but specific June 1940 operational status less detailed in sources."
