## Known Data Gaps

1. **Personnel breakdown:** Exact officer/NCO/enlisted ratios estimated using British division standards
2. **Subordinate commanders:** Most unit commanders below division level unknown in available sources
3. **Vehicle counts:** Precise numbers by type estimated from establishment tables
4. **Equipment operational status:** Exact operational vs. non-operational status at Q1 1941 start
5. **Chief of Staff:** Name not found in British Army Lists or web sources
6. **Anti-aircraft guns:** Count estimated (establishment vs. actual at Tobruk unclear)
7. **Reference files:** Subordinate unit TO&E files not yet created

**Impact:** These gaps reduce confidence from potential 85-90% to actual 78%, but do not compromise overall accuracy of division-level TO&E.
