- **Formed:** 27 April 1939, Salerno, Italy
- **Deployed to Libya:** September 1939
- **Home Station in Libya:** Gharyan (near Tripoli)

### Q1 1941 Status
The division was in a recovery/reserve posture during January-March 1941:

1. **Weakened by 1940 Transfers**
   - During summer-autumn 1940, all 5th Army units (including Savona) had men and equipment stripped away

2. **Not Involved in Operation COMPASS**
   - Did not participate in Italian invasion of Egypt (Sept 1940)
   - Remained in garrison while 10th Army advanced and was destroyed
   - Avoided losses of Operation COMPASS (British counteroffensive Dec 1940-Feb 1941)

3. **Reserve Status Q1 1941**
   - Held in reserve "somewhere in Tripolitania" (March 1941 sources)
   - Not involved in Rommel's initial offensive (late March 1941)
   - Rebuilding strength and training

4. **Later Service**
   - Moved forward June 1941 to border defense positions
   - Defended Sollum-Bardia-Halfaya Pass area
   - Heavily engaged during Operation Crusader (November 1941)

## VALIDATION & QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Schema Compliance: ✅ PASS
All validation checks passed:
- ✅ Nation lowercase: `italian`
- ✅ Schema type: `division_toe`
- ✅ Organization level: `division`
- ✅ Commander properly structured (not "Unknown")
- ✅ Tank totals balanced: 0 = 0 + 0 + 0
- ✅ Personnel totals matched: 10,864 = 404 + 2,180 + 8,280
- ✅ Top 3 weapons defined with counts
- ✅ Artillery total correct: 40 = 24 + 8 + 8
- ✅ Confidence ≥75%: 78%
- ✅ Multiple sources cited: 5 sources

### Confidence Breakdown by Category

| Data Category | Confidence | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Command Structure** | 85% | Pietro Maggiani confirmed from multiple sources |
| **Organization** | 90% | Standard Italian binary division from TM-E 30-420 |
| **Personnel Strength** | 75% | Based on standard TO&E, adjusted for known depletion |
| **Infantry Weapons** | 85% | Standard Italian division equipment from TME manual |
| **Artillery** | 80% | Confirmed from multiple OOB sources |
| **Vehicles** | 70% | Estimated from auto-transportable standard, not exact counts |
| **Historical Context** | 85% | Well-documented deployment history |
| **Overall** | **78%** | Meets minimum 75% threshold |

### Known Data Gaps
1. Specific regimental commander names for Q1 1941 not found
2. Exact vehicle counts estimated from standard TO&E (not Savona-specific)
3. Division strength percentage in Q1 1941 uncertain (~85% estimated)
4. Chief of Staff name not available
5. Some equipment variants assumed based on standard Italian issue

### Data Quality Notes
- **No Guessing:** All unknowns explicitly marked; estimates clearly labeled
- **Primary Sources:** Relied on official military manuals where available
- **Cross-Validation:** Commander, organization confirmed from multiple independent sources
- **Period Accuracy:** Q1 1941 specifically, not conflated with later periods
- **Italian Nomenclature:** Preserved original Italian unit designations

## TACTICAL ASSESSMENT

### Strengths
- Experienced desert garrison force (in Libya since 1939)
- Partial motorization (auto-transportable) allowed some strategic mobility
- Standard Italian binary division organization
- Trained defensive infantry

### Weaknesses
- Below strength in Q1 1941 (estimated ~85% of TO&E)
- Insufficient anti-tank weapons (only 8x 47mm guns)
- Limited true mobility despite "auto-transportable" classification
- Weakened by 1940 personnel/equipment transfers
- Inadequate for modern mobile warfare

### Wargaming Profile
- **Morale:** 6/10 (Regular troops, not elite)
- **Experience:** Regular (desert-adapted but not combat-tested in Q1 1941)
- **Best Use:** Static defense, garrison duties, reserve force
- **Special Rules:**
  - Auto-transportable (50% mobility)
  - Below Strength (-15% effectiveness)
  - Desert Veterans (+1 defensive bonus in desert)
