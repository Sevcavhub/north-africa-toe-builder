---

## 1. Overview

The 62nd Infantry Division "Marmarica" was a binary (two-regiment) autotrasportabile infantry division of the Royal Italian Army during the critical summer months of 1940 in North Africa. During Q3 1940 (July-September), the division transitioned from border security operations to offensive combat, participating in the Italian invasion of Egypt (9-16 September 1940). The division covered the 10th Army's right (inland) flank during the advance into Egypt, pushing through Halfaya Pass and establishing defensive positions along the escarpment from Sofafi to Halfaya.

The Marmarica entered Q3 1940 with recent combat experience from skirmishes at Fort Capuzzo (14 June - 23 July 1940), where Italian and British forces clashed repeatedly following Italy's entry into World War II. This border warfare gave the division practical desert combat experience that would prove valuable during the September invasion.

**Key Characteristics (Q3 1940)**:
- **Binary Structure**: Two infantry regiments (115th and 116th "Treviso")
- **Autotrasportabile**: Partial motorization with 269 trucks (not enough to move entire division at once)
- **Mixed Transport**: 1,735 mules and horses supplemented motor transport
- **Combat Experienced**: Blooded in Fort Capuzzo border fighting
- **Metropolitan Division**: Higher morale and training than colonial units
- **Invasion Role**: Right flank security during 105km advance into Egypt

## 2. Command Structure

**Division Commander**: Unknown (Generale di Divisione)  
**Chief of Staff**: Unknown (Colonnello)  
**Headquarters Location**: Halfaya Pass, Egypt (September 1940)  

**Staff Strength**:
- Officers: 34
- NCOs: 82
- Enlisted: 186
- **Total Staff**: 302

**Command Challenges in Q3 1940**:
- Transition from static defense to mobile offensive operations
- Coordination of mixed motor/animal transport during invasion
- Extended supply lines across Egyptian border (105km from Bardia)
- British harassing actions during advance to Halfaya Pass
- Defensive reorientation after halt order (16 September)

The division headquarters relocated from Bardia to forward positions at Halfaya Pass during the September invasion, managing the advance of two infantry regiments across difficult escarpment terrain while maintaining contact with neighboring formations of the 10th Army.

- **Fort Capuzzo Operations** (June-July): Continuous patrolling wore vehicles
- **Invasion Movement** (September): 105km advance strained aging trucks
- **Desert Conditions**: Sand, heat, poor roads accelerated mechanical failures
- **Maintenance**: Limited spare parts and workshop capacity
- **Fuel Constraints**: 12 days reserves (down from 15 in Q2)

Operational readiness fell from 90% (Q2) to 87.7% (Q3), requiring greater reliance on animal transport.

---

## 9. Animal Transport

The Marmarica Division relied heavily on animal transport, essential for operations in the rugged escarpment terrain around Halfaya Pass:

**Mules**: 1,200
- Primary role: Artillery towing, ammunition transport
- Capacity: 80-100kg per animal
- Terrain: Superior to vehicles on escarpment slopes
- Notes: Essential for 75mm and 100mm gun mobility in rough ground

**Horses**: 535
- Primary role: Officer mounts, light transport, reconnaissance
- Capacity: 60-80kg (pack)
- Terrain: Good for patrol work in broken ground
- Notes: Water requirements (30L/day) strained supplies

**Carts**: 202
- Type: Two-wheeled carts (mule/horse-drawn)
- Capacity: 300-400kg
- Role: Regimental supply distribution
- Notes: More economical than motor transport for local movement

**Total Animals**: 1,735

### Animal Transport in Q3 Operations

During the September invasion, animal transport proved critical:
- **Escarpment Terrain**: Trucks could not negotiate Halfaya Pass slopes; mules moved artillery and ammunition
- **Fuel Conservation**: Animal transport reduced motor fuel consumption
- **Reliability**: Mules required no spare parts, operated in any terrain
- **Water Burden**: 1,735 animals required ~50,000 liters/day (major logistical strain)

The mixed motor/animal system allowed the division to advance when vehicles broke down, but water requirements for animals created severe supply challenges in the waterless desert.

---

## 10. Aircraft

**Aircraft Total**: 0

The division had no organic air assets. Air support was provided by Regia Aeronautica units based in Libya, but Italian air superiority over the Western Desert was contested by RAF forces operating from Egypt.

**Air Support during September Invasion**:
- CR.42 fighters provided limited air cover
- SM.79 bombers struck British positions ahead of advance
- Ca.311 reconnaissance aircraft scouted British deployments
- Italian air effort hampered by fuel shortages and RAF opposition

---

## 11. Supply and Logistics

### Supply Status (Q3 1940)

**Overall Assessment**: Strained

The division's supply situation deteriorated during Q3 due to the September invasion, which extended supply lines 105km into Egypt and consumed reserves built up during Q2.

**Supply Chain**:
- **Primary Base**: Bardia (coastal port, 105km west of Halfaya)
- **Secondary Base**: Tobruk (210km west of Halfaya)
- **Forward Dumps**: Established at Halfaya Pass (September 1940)
- **Transport**: Mixed motor/animal, increasing reliance on mules

### Fuel Reserves

**Fuel Reserves**: 12 days (down from 15 days in Q2)

**Consumption Patterns**:
- **Fort Capuzzo Operations** (June-July): Consumed reserves through patrolling
- **Invasion Movement** (9-16 September): Heavy consumption during 105km advance
- **Defensive Phase** (mid-September): Reduced consumption in static positions

**Challenges**:
- Insufficient motorization meant trucks made multiple trips, increasing fuel burn
- Desert conditions reduced fuel efficiency
- Extended supply lines increased fuel needed for transport itself
- Italian logistical system prioritized coastal units over flank formations

### Ammunition Reserves

**Ammunition Reserves**: 18 days (down from 20 days in Q2)

**Expenditure**:
- **Fort Capuzzo** (June-July): Light small arms expenditure
- **Invasion** (9-16 September): Moderate artillery and small arms use vs British harassing forces
- **Resupply**: Difficult due to extended lines from Bardia

**Ammunition Status by Type**:
- Rifle/MG: 18 days (adequate for defensive operations)
- Artillery (75mm/100mm): 15 days (moderate stocks)
- Mortar (81mm): 20 days (good stocks)
- AT (47mm): 12 days (limited stocks, low consumption)

### Water Supply

**Water Allocation**: 2.5 liters/man/day (reduced from 3L in Q2)

**Water Crisis**:
- **Personnel**: 10,864 men required 27,160 liters/day
- **Animals**: 1,735 animals required ~50,000 liters/day
- **Total Daily Requirement**: ~77,000 liters/day

**Water Sources**:
- No natural water at Halfaya Pass or Sofafi
- All water trucked from Bardia or Tobruk
- British harassed supply convoys, disrupting water delivery
- Heat and exertion increased consumption beyond official allocation

The water situation was the most critical supply constraint, forcing reduced rations and limiting operational tempo.

### Operational Radius

**Operational Radius**: 40km (reduced from 50km in Q2)

The division's mobility was constrained by:
- Partial motorization (only ~40% of division could move by truck simultaneously)
- Fuel limitations (12 days reserves)
- Water constraints (required resupply every 2-3 days maximum)
- Vehicle wear (87.7% operational rate)

### Logistical Challenges (Q3 1940)

1. **Extended Supply Lines**: 105km from Bardia to Halfaya
2. **British Interdiction**: RAF and mobile columns harassed convoys
3. **Water Scarcity**: No natural sources, entirely dependent on trucked water
4. **Vehicle Attrition**: Desert wear reduced transport capacity
5. **Animal Water Needs**: 1,735 animals consumed vast water quantities
6. **Poor Roads**: Desert tracks slowed convoys, increased breakdowns
7. **Fuel Priority**: Coastal formations received priority over flank units

These logistical strains limited the division's ability to conduct sustained offensive operations and contributed to the 10th Army's decision to halt at Sidi Barrani rather than continue toward Alexandria.

---

## 12. Weather and Environmental Conditions

### Season: 1940-Q3 (July-September)

**Climate**: High summer in the Egypt/Libya border region

### Temperature

**Range**: 22°C (minimum) to 42°C (maximum)

**Impact on Operations**:
- **Heat Exhaustion**: Extreme temperatures caused high casualty rates from heat stroke
- **Equipment**: Metal surfaces too hot to touch, vehicle interiors reached 50°C+
- **Water Consumption**: Personnel and animals required maximum hydration
- **Night Operations**: Temperature drop to 22°C made night movement preferable
- **Ammunition**: Propellant affected by heat, reducing consistency

July-August were the hottest months, with daytime temperatures regularly exceeding 40°C in the shade (when shade existed). September saw slight moderation but remained extremely hot.

### Terrain

**Type**: Desert escarpment and coastal plain - Halfaya Pass, Sofafi region

**Characteristics**:
- **Halfaya Pass**: Critical escarpment passage, steep slopes negotiable only by pack animals
- **Escarpment**: 200m cliff separating coastal plain from inland plateau
- **Surface**: Rocky desert, gravel plains, limited areas of soft sand
- **Water**: None - completely arid region
- **Vegetation**: Virtually none, no cover or concealment

**Tactical Impact**:
- **Visibility**: Excellent - no cover for approaching forces
- **Mobility**: Wheeled vehicles confined to tracks; escarpment impassable to trucks
- **Defensive Positions**: Rocky ground allowed good entrenchment
- **Observation**: Escarpment provided commanding views over coastal approaches

### Storm Frequency

**Days with Storms**: 0

Q3 (July-September) is the driest period in North Africa. No rainfall, sandstorms, or significant weather events occurred during this quarter. The Mediterranean coast receives occasional storms in winter (Q4-Q1) but summer is completely dry.

### Daylight Hours

**Average Daylight**: 13 hours

**Operational Impact**:
- **Long Days**: Extended daylight allowed long marches during invasion
- **Heat Exposure**: More hours of extreme heat increased water needs
- **Night Operations**: 11 hours of darkness allowed concealed movement
- **Navigation**: Clear skies and stars aided desert navigation

### Environmental Challenges (Q3 1940)

1. **Heat**: 42°C maximum temperatures caused heat casualties
2. **Aridity**: No water sources, entirely dependent on trucked supply
3. **Dust**: Fine dust infiltrated weapons, engines, and equipment
4. **Sun Exposure**: Intense UV caused sunburn and eye strain
5. **Terrain**: Escarpment limited vehicle mobility, favored pack animals
6. **Visibility**: Dust clouds from vehicles visible for miles, betraying movements
7. **Flies**: Massive fly populations spread disease in static positions

The environmental conditions during Q3 1940 were among the most extreme faced by the division, contributing to reduced operational readiness and limiting the 10th Army's ability to sustain offensive operations beyond Sidi Barrani.

## 13. Tactical Doctrine and Combat Performance

### Primary Role (Q3 1940)

**Right flank security and defensive operations during Italian invasion of Egypt**

The Marmarica Division was assigned the critical task of securing the 10th Army's right (inland) flank during the September 1940 invasion. While coastal formations (1st Blackshirt Division, 2nd Blackshirt Division, 4th Blackshirt Division) and the Maletti Group advanced along the coast road toward Sidi Barrani, the Marmarica moved through the desert interior, occupying Halfaya Pass and the Sofafi escarpment positions.

### Special Capabilities

**1. Autotrasportabile Organization**:
- Partial motorization (269 trucks) provided limited mobility
- Could move ~40% of division by truck in single lift
- Remaining 60% moved by foot/animal transport in follow-up lifts
- Faster strategic deployment than pure foot-mobile divisions

**2. Desert Operations Adapted**:
- Mixed motor/animal transport system allowed operation when vehicles grounded
- Personnel acclimatized to desert heat and water discipline
- Navigation skills developed during training in Libya
- Experience with desert supply challenges

**3. Escarpment Terrain Operations**:
- Extensive mule train (1,200 mules) enabled movement of artillery and supplies over escarpment
- Infantry trained in rough terrain operations
- Engineers skilled in improving tracks and passes

**4. Combat Experience**:
- Blooded in Fort Capuzzo skirmishes (June-July 1940)
- Familiar with British harassing tactics (armored cars, long-range fire)
- Recent combat improved NCO leadership and small-unit tactics

### Known Issues

**1. Insufficient Motorization**:
- Only 269 trucks for 10,864-man division
- Required multiple lifts to move entire division
- Slowed operational tempo compared to fully motorized forces
- Increased fuel consumption through repeated trips

**2. Obsolete Artillery**:
- WWI-era 75mm and 100mm guns (captured Austrian equipment from 1918)
- Limited range (10,300m for 75mm vs 12,500m for British 25-pounder)
- Worn barrels reduced accuracy
- Spare parts scarce

**3. Limited Anti-Tank Capability**:
- Only 8x 47mm AT guns for entire division
- Inadequate against British Matilda II heavy infantry tanks (armor too thick)
- Effective only against light tanks and armored cars
- No organic anti-tank rifles or shaped charges

**4. Binary Structure Undermanned**:
- Two regiments (5,800 infantry) vs three regiments in triangular divisions (~9,000 infantry)
- Reduced ability to sustain prolonged combat
- Fewer reserves for counterattacks or plugging gaps
- Higher casualty sensitivity (less depth)

**5. Vehicle Wear**:
- Desert operations reduced operational rate to 87.7% (down from 90% in Q2)
- Maintenance facilities inadequate for fleet size
- Spare parts shortages
- Aging truck designs (1930s civilian conversions)

**6. Extended Supply Lines**:
- 105km from Bardia to Halfaya Pass
- Increased logistical strain
- Fuel and water reserves depleted faster
- Vulnerable to British mobile column interdiction

### Desert Adaptations

**Mixed Motor and Animal Transport System**:

The division's hybrid transport organization proved essential during Q3 operations:

- **Invasion Advance** (9-16 September): Trucks moved infantry to Halfaya region; mules brought artillery up escarpment slopes
- **Water Supply**: Animal transport allowed distribution of water when trucks unavailable
- **Rough Terrain**: Mule trains operated where vehicles could not go
- **Fuel Conservation**: Animal transport reduced motor fuel consumption in static positions

The 1,735-animal train was not a liability but a critical enabler for operations in the escarpment terrain around Halfaya Pass.

### Combat Performance (Q3 1940)

**Fort Capuzzo Skirmishes (14 June - 23 July 1940)**:

The division's first combat occurred immediately after Italy's entry into World War II. British forces from the 7th Armoured Division and 4th Indian Division conducted raids on Fort Capuzzo and other border posts, seeking to dominate no-man's-land.

**Lessons Learned**:
- British armored cars highly mobile, difficult to engage
- Need for better coordination between infantry, AT guns, and artillery
- Desert navigation skills critical
- Water discipline essential for sustained operations

**Italian Invasion of Egypt (9-16 September 1940)**:

The Marmarica's primary combat action in Q3:

**9 September**: Division begins advance from Sidi Omar  
**11-13 September**: Skirmishes with British 7th Armoured Division harassing parties  
**13 September**: Division converges on Halfaya Pass, pushes through to escarpment top  
**13 September (evening)**: Halt order received, division prepares defensive positions  
**14-16 September**: Consolidation of Sofafi-Halfaya escarpment line  

**Performance Assessment**:
- **Morale**: Good - metropolitan division maintained cohesion under British harassment
- **Leadership**: Adequate - regimental commanders managed mixed-capability forces effectively
- **Logistics**: Strained - water and fuel shortages developed by 16 September
- **Coordination**: Satisfactory - division maintained contact with neighboring formations
- **Casualties**: Light - British focused on delaying rather than decisive engagement

**Defensive Positions (Mid-September to December 1940)**:

After the invasion halt, the division manned static defensive positions along the escarpment from Sofafi to Halfaya. These positions were intended to protect the 10th Army's flank but were exposed and difficult to supply.

**Tactical Innovations**: None documented

The division employed standard Italian infantry tactics adapted for desert conditions. No significant tactical innovations emerged during Q3 operations.

## 15. Historical Notes

### Formation and Pre-War History

**Formation Date**: 9 May 1937  
**Formation Location**: Derna, Libya

The 62nd Infantry Division "Marmarica" was formed in 1937 as part of Italy's expansion of forces in Libya. The division was named after the ancient Greek name for the region of eastern Libya (Marmarica), reflecting its permanent assignment to the colony.

**Original Organization**:
- Binary (two-regiment) structure from inception
- Autotrasportabile classification (partial motorization)
- Metropolitan personnel (not colonial troops)
- Three regiments renamed "Marmarica" in 1939:
  - 115th Infantry Regiment "Treviso" (became "Marmarica")
  - 116th Infantry Regiment "Treviso" (became "Marmarica")
  - 44th Artillery Regiment (became "Marmarica")

Despite the 1939 renaming, official records often retained the original "Treviso" designations for the infantry regiments, creating documentation confusion.

### Status: 1940-Q3 (July-September)

**Operational Status**: Combat operational

**Location Timeline**:
- **July 1940**: Bardia garrison, border security duty
- **June-July**: Fort Capuzzo skirmishes (14 June - 23 July)
- **August 1940**: Bardia/border zone, preparing for invasion
- **9 September**: Advance begins from Sidi Omar
- **13 September**: Occupies Halfaya Pass
- **16 September**: Established defensive positions, Sofafi-Halfaya escarpment line
- **Late September**: Static defense, supply consolidation

**Combat Actions**:
1. **Fort Capuzzo Skirmishes** (14 June - 23 July 1940): First combat for the division. Italian and British forces clashed repeatedly in the border zone as both sides sought to dominate no-man's-land. The Marmarica participated in these small-unit actions, gaining valuable combat experience but suffering light casualties and vehicle wear.

2. **Italian Invasion of Egypt** (9-16 September 1940): The division's primary action in Q3. Advancing from Sidi Omar, the Marmarica covered the 10th Army's right (inland) flank during Marshal Graziani's offensive. On 13 September, the division pushed past British harassing parties (elements of the 7th Armoured Division) and converged on Halfaya Pass, a critical escarpment passage. After forcing the pass, the division reached the top of the escarpment and was ordered to halt and prepare defensive positions. The advance covered approximately 105km from the Libyan border into Egypt.

3. **Defensive Consolidation** (mid-September 1940): After the invasion halt at Sidi Barrani (16 September), the division established defensive positions along the escarpment from Sofafi to Halfaya Pass. These positions protected the 10th Army's inland flank but were difficult to supply and exposed to British mobile forces. The division remained in these positions through the end of Q3 and into Q4, when British Operation Compass would overrun them.

**Supply Situation**:
- Motor transport worn from Fort Capuzzo operations and invasion movement
- Fuel reserves reduced to 12 days (from 15 in Q2)
- Ammunition stocks at 18 days (down from 20 in Q2)
- Water critical constraint: 2.5L/man/day in extreme heat
- Supply lines extended 105km from Bardia to Halfaya

**Readiness**:
- Vehicle operational rate: 87.7% (down from 90% in Q2)
- Personnel strength: 10,864 (full establishment, light casualties from skirmishing)
- Morale: 6/10 (stable, combat-experienced)
- Combat effectiveness: Good for defensive operations, limited offensive capability

### Combat Record

The Marmarica Division's combat record in 1940 was typical of Italian metropolitan divisions in North Africa: competent defensive performance but limited offensive capability due to mobility and firepower constraints.

**Strengths**:
- Metropolitan personnel (higher morale and training than colonial units)
- Combat experience from border warfare
- Mixed motor/animal transport allowed operation in difficult terrain
- Defensive discipline and entrenchment skills

**Weaknesses**:
- Insufficient motorization for sustained offensive operations
- Obsolete artillery outranged by British 25-pounders
- Weak anti-tank capability (vulnerable to British armor)
- Binary structure left division undermanned
- Extended supply lines strained logistics

The division's fate was sealed during British Operation Compass (December 1940-January 1941). Isolated in Bardia after the British breakthrough, the Marmarica was destroyed during the Australian assault on the fortress (3-5 January 1941). The division surrendered on 5 January 1941 and was never reformed.

### Notable Features

**1. Ancient Name**: "Marmarica" derives from the Greek name for eastern Libya (roughly modern-day Cyrenaica), chosen to emphasize the division's permanent assignment to the region.

**2. Regiment Renaming Confusion**: In 1939, the 115th and 116th Infantry Regiments were officially renamed from "Treviso" to "Marmarica," but many documents continued to use the original "Treviso" designation, creating historical record confusion.

**3. Autotrasportabile Organization**: The division's partial motorization was intended to allow strategic mobility when trucks were available, but in practice, insufficient vehicles meant the division operated more like foot-mobile infantry with limited truck support.

**4. Animal Transport Reliance**: The division's 1,735 mules and horses were not a colonial anachronism but a deliberate adaptation to North African terrain, where escarpments and soft sand often defeated wheeled vehicles.

**5. Metropolitan Division in Libya**: Unlike many Libyan garrison units composed of colonial troops, the Marmarica was a metropolitan division with Italian conscripts, reflecting its intended role as a first-line combat formation.

### Fate

**Destroyed**: 5 January 1941, Battle of Bardia

After the Italian invasion of Egypt stalled at Sidi Barrani in September 1940, the 10th Army settled into static defensive positions. British Commonwealth forces launched Operation Compass in December 1940, achieving complete tactical surprise. The Marmarica Division, isolated in Bardia, was besieged by the Australian 6th Division.

On 3 January 1941, Australian forces assaulted the Bardia perimeter. After three days of fierce fighting, the Italian garrison surrendered on 5 January. The Marmarica Division ceased to exist, with survivors entering prisoner-of-war camps in Egypt.

**The division was never reformed.**
