**season quarter**: 1941-Q4 (October-December)

**temperature range c**: [object Object]

**terrain type**: Western Desert - open rocky desert with wadis, escarpments near coast. Excellent tank country but retreat conducted over 400km to El Agheila.

**terrain effects**: Cooler temperatures favorable for operations but heavy combat and retreat negated advantages. Dust clouds from retreating columns visible to RAF. Limited water sources during withdrawal critical constraint.

**storm frequency days**: 3

**daylight hours**: 11

**seasonal notes**: Q4 winter conditions (October-December): Cooler temperatures (12-28°C) reduced heat stress vs Q3 (22-44°C). Occasional winter rains turned wadis into obstacles. Shorter daylight (11 vs 13.5 hours Q3) limited operational tempo. Clear skies continued RAF threat during retreat.
