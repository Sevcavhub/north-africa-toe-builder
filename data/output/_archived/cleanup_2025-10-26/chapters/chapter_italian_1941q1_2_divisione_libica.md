## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Colonial infantry division with Italian officers and Libyan NCOs/troops. Designed for static defense of fortified camps in Egyptian Western Desert. Part of Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940) and defensive operations at Sidi Barrani.

### Special Capabilities

- Libyan paratroop battalion 'Fanti dell'Aria' (elite airborne unit)
- Adapted to desert conditions (Libyan troops native to region)
- Fortified camp defense tactics

### Known Issues

- ⚠️ VULNERABLE POSITION: Tummar camp exposed to British armor attack
- ⚠️ UNABLE TO SUPPORT OTHER UNITS: Distance from 1st Libyan Division at Maktila prevented mutual support
- Inferior equipment compared to regular Italian divisions (77/28 vs 75/27 guns)
- Colonial troops lower training standard than metropolitan Italian troops
- Poor coordination between infantry groups during British attack
- Sandstorm on December 10 disrupted visibility and communications
- Rapid collapse after initial resistance - morale broke quickly

**Desert Adaptations:** Libyan troops well-adapted to desert conditions (native to region). Division trained for static defense of fortified camps rather than mobile operations.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Morale** | 5/10 |
| **Experience** | Regular |

### Special Rules

- Colonial Division: -1 to training, +1 to desert terrain
- Isolated Position: Cannot receive support from other Italian units at Tummar
- Fortified Camp: +2 to defense when in prepared positions
- Division Destroyed (Dec 11, 1940): Heavy casualties - 26 officers + 1,327 men KIA, 32 officers + 804 wounded
- Sandstorm Penalty: -2 to visibility and coordination on December 10, 1940

### Scenario Suitability

- Operation Compass - Battle of Tummar (December 10-11, 1940)
- Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940)
- Static defense of fortified camps scenario
- Colonial division vs British armored/infantry combined arms

### Historical Engagements

- Italian invasion of Egypt (September 13, 1940)
- Static defense at Tummar fortified camp (September-December 1940)
- Operation Compass - Battle of Tummar (December 10, 1940)
- Destruction with heavy casualties (December 11, 1940 - 26 officers + 1,327 men KIA)

## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Overall Confidence:** 80%

### Primary Sources

- Web search - 2nd Libyan Division Italy Wikipedia (formation March 1, 1940, colonial division structure)
- Web search - Operation Compass Wikipedia (Tummar position, December 10-11, 1940 destruction)
- Web search - Battle of Sidi Barrani articles (division at Tummar, casualties: 26 officers + 1,327 men KIA, 32 officers + 804 wounded)
- Web search - Libyan Paratroop Battalion 'Fanti dell'Aria' (500 paratroopers, 4 companies)
- Web search - Libyan Corps commanded by Lt-Gen Sebastiano Gallina
- Italian colonial division TO&E (2 infantry groups, 1 artillery group, 77/28 guns)
- Operation Compass order of battle (2nd Libyan at Tummar, 1st Libyan at Maktila, 22-mile separation)

### Known Data Gaps

- Infantry group and artillery group commander names not found
- Exact personnel breakdown by unit uncertain (estimated from standard colonial division structure)
- Precise vehicle numbers estimated from colonial division standards
- Equipment serial numbers unknown
- Detailed battle chronology December 10-11 limited (sandstorm, confusion)
- Division commander name not found in sources
- Casualties documented: 26 officers + 1,327 men KIA, 32 officers + 804 wounded, survivors POWs

### Additional Notes

⚠️ CRITICAL: Division destroyed December 10-11, 1940 during Operation Compass.

Q1 1941 listing represents final status at time of destruction - division did NOT exist as functional unit during January-March 1941.

Data represents division strength and organization at time of destruction (December 1940).

Division formed March 1, 1940 from Italian Libyan Colonial Division.

Part of Libyan Corps commanded by Lt-Gen Sebastiano Gallina.

8,000 troops estimated (Italian officers, Libyan NCOs/troops).

Positioned at Tummar fortified camp (22 miles from 1st Libyan Division at Maktila).

Attacked December 10, 1940 during sandstorm as part of Operation Compass.

Suffered heavy casualties: 26 officers and 1,327 men killed, 32 officers and 804 men wounded.

Division declared lost December 11, 1940 - survivors became POWs.

Organization based on standard Italian colonial division (2 infantry groups, 1 artillery group, 77/28 field guns).

Included elite Libyan Paratroop Battalion 'Fanti dell'Aria' with 500 paratroopers.

Specific casualty figures documented from historical sources.

Confidence 80% due to good sources on destruction and casualties, but commander name unknown and unit-level detail limited.

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
