# 1st South African Division

**Commonwealth Forces (South Africa) • 1940 Q4 (October-December) • East Africa Theater, Kenya**

---

## Division Overview

The 1st South African Division represents the Union of South Africa's first divisional-level formation deployed for overseas service in World War II. Formed in August 1940 under the command of Brigadier General George Brink, the division was committed to support British Empire operations in the East African Campaign against Italian forces in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland.

During the fourth quarter of 1940, the division was in its initial deployment phase rather than active combat operations. The 1st South African Infantry Brigade, which had formed in Pretoria in May 1940, was the first element to deploy to Kenya in July. Division Headquarters followed, landing at Mombasa on November 11, 1940. The 2nd and 5th Infantry Brigades deployed separately, with the division not fully assembled until late 1940/early 1941.

Unlike its later deployment to the Western Desert and North Africa (1941-1943), where the 1st South African Division would earn distinction at Gazala, Tobruk, and El Alamein, the unit's role in late 1940 was primarily organizational and preparatory. The division faced significant equipment shortages, particularly in transport and armored vehicles, with sources describing resources as "limited" and noting the division possessed "few armoured vehicles" during this period. It would not reach 90% of its allotted transport until June 1941.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This unit was deployed to the **East African theater** during 1940-Q4, not North Africa. It may fall outside the scope of the North Africa TO&E Builder project for this specific quarter.

## Order of Battle

The 1st South African Division comprised three infantry brigade groups, each with supporting elements. During 1940-Q4, these formations were deploying separately to Kenya and were not yet fully integrated as a cohesive division.

### 1st South African Infantry Brigade
**Commander**: Colonel John Daniel  
**Formation**: May 1940 (Pretoria)  
**Deployment**: Kenya (arrived July 1940) - First SA formation in theater

## Armoured Strength

**DATA UNAVAILABLE**: The 1st South African Division was an infantry formation and did not possess tanks. Armored support was limited to armoured car companies at brigade level.

### Armoured Cars

The division possessed two South African Armoured Car Companies (No. 1 and No. 2), equipped with locally-designed **Marmon-Herrington armoured cars**. However, exact numbers are unavailable for 1940-Q4.

**Marmon-Herrington Armoured Car** - Numbers Unknown

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: Breda 20mm automatic cannon
- **Design**: South African locally-designed prototype
- **Role**: Reconnaissance and screening operations

**Combat Performance**: The Marmon-Herrington was a South African improvisation born of necessity, as British armoured car production could not meet Commonwealth demands. While equipped with the effective Breda 20mm gun, the vehicle's armor protection was light, limiting its utility in direct combat. The design was well-suited to the expansive terrain of East Africa, where mobility and mechanical reliability were prioritized over heavy armament.

**Deployment Status**: Sources indicate the division possessed "few armoured vehicles" during 1940-Q4. The two armoured car companies were assigned at brigade level (No. 1 to 5th Brigade, No. 2 to 2nd Brigade), but precise vehicle counts are not documented for this period.

| Category | Total | Operational | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Armoured Cars** | **Unknown** | **Unknown** | Limited numbers |
| ↳ Marmon-Herrington | Unknown | Unknown | Deploying |

## Artillery Strength

**DATA UNAVAILABLE**: Specific artillery regiment designations and gun counts for the 1st South African Division during 1940-Q4 are not available from primary sources.

**Historical Context**: Sources mention "brigade artillery" and "divisional artillery" in general terms, and later references (1941-1942) indicate the division used **25-pounder field guns**, which were the standard British Commonwealth field artillery piece. However, without primary source documentation, exact battery compositions, gun counts, and regimental designations cannot be confirmed for the 1940-Q4 period.

A fully-established Commonwealth infantry division would typically field:
- 3 field artillery regiments (24 guns each = 72 total 25-pounders)
- 1 anti-tank regiment (48 guns)
- 1 light anti-aircraft regiment (54 guns)

However, the 1st SA Division was not at full establishment during 1940-Q4.

### Known Artillery Elements

- **Brigade artillery** mentioned for 1st SA Infantry Brigade (composition unknown)
- **Divisional artillery** mentioned in later operations (composition unknown for 1940-Q4)

| Type | Total | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Field Artillery (25-pounders)** | **Unknown** | Deploying |
| **Anti-Tank Artillery** | **Unknown** | Unknown - Anti-tank batteries mentioned in 1942 sources |
| **Anti-Aircraft Artillery** | **Unknown** | Unknown |
| **Total Artillery** | **Unknown** | Incomplete establishment |

## Infantry Weapons

**DATA UNAVAILABLE**: Detailed counts of infantry small arms for the 1st South African Division during 1940-Q4 are not available from primary sources.

**Standard Equipment**: South African forces used British-pattern small arms and organization. A Commonwealth infantry battalion of this era would typically be equipped with:

- **Lee-Enfield No. 1 Mk III rifles** (bolt-action, .303 British caliber) - Standard rifle
- **Bren light machine guns** (.303 caliber, magazine-fed) - Section automatic weapon
- **Vickers medium machine guns** (.303 caliber, belt-fed, water-cooled) - Battalion support weapon
- **Boys anti-tank rifles** (.55 caliber) - Platoon-level anti-tank weapon
- **2-inch mortars** - Platoon support
- **3-inch mortars** - Battalion support

With 9 infantry battalions (3 per brigade), the division would require thousands of rifles and hundreds of light machine guns when at full establishment. However, exact counts are unavailable for 1940-Q4.

| Weapon Type | Total | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| **Rifles (Lee-Enfield)** | **Unknown** | Standard Commonwealth equipment |
| **Light Machine Guns (Bren)** | **Unknown** | Standard Commonwealth equipment |
| **Medium Machine Guns (Vickers)** | **Unknown** | Battalion-level support |
| **Anti-Tank Rifles (Boys)** | **Unknown** | Platoon-level AT weapon |

## Transport & Vehicles

**Transport Status**: Sources describe the 1st South African Division's transport situation during 1940-Q4 as "limited," with the division possessing "few armoured vehicles." The 1st Transvaal Scottish Regiment was designated as the first motorized battalion and received transport accordingly, but overall divisional transport was incomplete.

By June 1941, the division had reached approximately **90% of its allotted transport**, with many vehicles being "those which had been used in the East Africa campaign," suggesting equipment was acquired and accumulated during operations rather than being fully issued during the 1940-Q4 deployment phase.

| Category | Total | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Total Vehicles** | **Unknown** | Limited - below full establishment |
| **Trucks (soft-skin)** | **Unknown** | Insufficient for full motorization |
| **Staff Cars** | **Unknown** | - |
| **Motorcycles** | **Unknown** | - |

**Motorization**: Only the 1st Transvaal Scottish was described as motorized during 1940-Q4. The remaining eight infantry battalions would have relied on marching or limited transport.

## Divisional Troops

### Engineers

**Field Companies Identified**:
- **12th Field Company, SA Corps of Engineers** (2nd Brigade)
- **5th Field Company, SA Corps of Engineers** (5th Brigade)

**Divisional Engineer Regiment**: Not documented for 1940-Q4. A divisional engineer regiment would typically exist at divisional level, but specific designation is unavailable.

**Capabilities**: Field companies provided engineer support including bridging, mine clearance, demolitions, and field fortifications at brigade level.

### Signals

**Brigade Signals Companies Identified**:
- **1 Brigade Signals Company, SA Corps of Signals** (5th Brigade)
- **3 Brigade Signals Company, SA Corps of Signals** (2nd Brigade)

**Divisional Signals Unit**: Not documented for 1940-Q4. A divisional signals regiment would typically coordinate communications, but specific designation is unavailable.

### Medical Services

**Field Ambulances Identified**:
- **11th Field Ambulance, SA Medical Corps** (5th Brigade)
- **12th Field Ambulance, SA Medical Corps** (2nd Brigade)

**Additional Medical Notes**: "Voluntary aid nurses" were noted embarking with the Royal Natal Carbineers in July 1940.

**Divisional Medical Units**: Additional divisional-level medical units (casualty clearing stations, field hospitals) were likely planned but are not documented for 1940-Q4.

### Supply & Transport

**Mobile General Workshops**:
- **No. 2 Mobile General Workshops, SA Technical Services Corps** (2nd Brigade)
- **No. 3 Mobile General Workshops, SA Technical Services Corps** (5th Brigade)

These workshops provided field maintenance and repair for vehicles and equipment at brigade level.

**Divisional Supply Units**: Divisional-level supply companies, ammunition companies, and transport columns were likely planned but are not documented for 1940-Q4.

## Operational Readiness

**Status**: **Deploying** - Division was in its initial deployment phase during 1940-Q4 and not at full operational readiness.

**Training Status**: Division was forming and deploying to theater. Individual brigades arrived separately (1st Brigade in July, Division HQ in November), with the division not fully assembled until late 1940 or early 1941.

**Supply Status**: **Limited** - Transport and equipment shortages were specifically noted. Division would not reach 90% of allotted transport until June 1941.

**Combat Status**: Not engaged in major combat operations during 1940-Q4. The East African Campaign's major offensive operations (conquest of Italian East Africa) would occur in 1941.

---

## Strategic Context

**Campaign**: East African Campaign (1940-1941)  
**Theater**: East Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Italian Somaliland)  
**Enemy**: Italian forces in Italian East Africa

**Strategic Situation**: Following Italy's entry into the war in June 1940, Italian forces in East Africa (approximately 200,000 Italian and colonial troops) posed a threat to British colonies in Kenya, Sudan, and British Somaliland. The Union of South Africa committed the 1st South African Division to support British Empire operations to eliminate this threat.

During 1940-Q4, the strategic situation was primarily defensive. British and Commonwealth forces were consolidating positions in Kenya while planning offensive operations to invade Italian-held territory. The 1st SA Division's deployment was part of this build-up, with full offensive operations commencing in early 1941.

**Operations**: The division was not engaged in major combat operations during 1940-Q4. Its role was organizational - deploying, assembling, training, and preparing for the coming offensive into Italian East Africa.

## Equipment Shortages

The 1st South African Division faced significant equipment shortages during its initial deployment in 1940-Q4:

### Critical Shortages

1. **Transport Vehicles**: Described as "limited" with the division well below full establishment. Only one battalion (1st Transvaal Scottish) was fully motorized. The division would not reach 90% of allotted transport until June 1941.

2. **Armoured Vehicles**: Sources specifically note the division possessed "few armoured vehicles" during this period. While two armoured car companies were assigned (No. 1 and No. 2 SA Armoured Car Companies), numbers were limited.

3. **Artillery**: Specific artillery units and gun counts are unavailable, suggesting artillery establishment was incomplete during 1940-Q4.

4. **Supply Equipment**: General shortage of supply vehicles, workshops, and logistical equipment during initial deployment.

### Improvisation & Local Production

South Africa's geographic isolation from British supply lines necessitated local improvisation:

- **Marmon-Herrington armoured cars**: Locally-designed and produced in South Africa due to inability to procure British armoured cars
- **Equipment acquisition during campaign**: Sources note that by June 1941, many vehicles were "those which had been used in the East Africa campaign," indicating equipment was captured, salvaged, or locally procured during operations rather than being issued before deployment

These shortages were typical for Commonwealth forces in secondary theaters during 1940-1941, when British production was prioritized for home defense and the Western Desert.

---

## Historical Outcome

The 1st South African Division would go on to play a significant role in the East African Campaign of 1941, participating in the conquest of Italian East Africa. Following victory in East Africa, the division was redeployed to North Africa (Western Desert) in 1941, where it served with distinction at Gazala (1942), the siege of Tobruk, and the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 1942).

During the 1940-Q4 period, however, the division was still forming and had not yet proven itself in combat. Its deployment to Kenya marked South Africa's commitment to the Allied cause and the beginning of South African ground forces' significant contribution to the war effort.

## Theater Note: East Africa vs. North Africa

**CRITICAL CAVEAT**: The 1st South African Division was deployed to the **East African theater** (Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea operations) during 1940-Q4, **NOT** the North Africa theater (Libya, Egypt, Western Desert).

The division would not transfer to North Africa until 1941, after completing operations in East Africa. Therefore, this unit may fall **outside the scope** of the "North Africa TO&E Builder" project during the 1940-Q4 quarter.

**Project Scope Consideration**: If the North Africa TO&E Builder project is strictly focused on units operating in Libya, Egypt, and the Western Desert, this unit should potentially be excluded for 1940-Q4 and only included starting from its 1941 deployment to North Africa.
