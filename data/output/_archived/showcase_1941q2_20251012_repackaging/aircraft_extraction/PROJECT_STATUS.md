- **Commonwealth**: SAAF (Hurricane, Maryland), RAAF (253 Wing participation)
- **Estimated Strength**: 10-15 squadrons, 150-200+ aircraft
- **Files**: `british_1941q2_raf_raw_facts.json` (15 facts, 80% confidence ‚Üí 90% after v4 validation)

### Deliverables Created ‚úÖ

1. **Raw Extraction Files** (3 files)
   - `german_1941q2_luftwaffe_raw_facts.json`
   - `italian_1941q2_regia_aeronautica_raw_facts.json`
   - `british_1941q2_raf_raw_facts.json`

2. **Structured Database** (1 file)
   - `1941q2_north_africa_aircraft_database.json` - Complete hierarchical database with metadata

3. **WITW Integration** (1 file)
   - `1941q2_aircraft_witw_mappings.json` - Maps historical aircraft ‚Üí WITW database IDs

4. **Documentation** (2 files)
   - `AIRCRAFT_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md` - 15-page comprehensive report
   - `CROSS_VALIDATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Bidirectional validation methodology

### Methodology Innovations ‚úÖ

#### Bidirectional Validation Established
- **Workflow**: Primary Sources First ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Validate Against v4 JSON
- **v4 JSONs**: Validation tools ONLY, never primary research sources
- **Benefits**:
  - Confirms extractions when v4 matches (boost confidence 80%‚Üí90%)
  - Detects v4 errors when primary sources contradict (e.g., StG 3)
  - Maintains academic rigor (no circular reasoning)

#### v4 Data Audit Results
- **Errors Found**: German StG 3 incorrectly included in 1941-Q2
- **Data Confirmed**: British aircraft types 100% accurate
- **Demonstrates**: Validation working bidirectionally

### Git Commit ‚úÖ
- **Commit**: `1e6d968` - "feat: Complete Phase 7 Aircraft Extraction for 1941-Q2 North Africa"
- **Files Added**: 10 files (7 aircraft data + 3 task completion markers)
- **Total Changes**: 2,127 insertions

### Memory Saved ‚úÖ
- **Entity**: "1941-Q2 Aircraft Extraction Project" with 9 observations
- **Entity**: "Bidirectional Validation Methodology" with 6 observations

### Phase 8: WITW Equipment Mapper ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETE - All aircraft mapped to WITW IDs

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-12

**Results**:
- **Total Aircraft Mapped**: 19 aircraft types (all 3 nations)
- **WITW IDs Found**: 1 (MC.202 Folgore: ID 65)
- **Custom IDs Assigned**: 6 (range 160001-160006)
- **Research Method**: WebSearch (Matrix Games forums, WITW documentation)

**Custom IDs Assigned**:
1. **160001** - Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk (British) - early P-40 variant
2. **160002** - Vickers Wellington (British) - WITW focuses on Western Front
3. **160003** - Cant. Z-1007 Bis (Italian) - not in WITW database
4. **160004** - Westland Lysander (British) - specialized aircraft
5. **160005** - Martin Maryland (British) - early variant (Baltimore is ID 607)
6. **160006** - Bristol Beaufighter (British) - WITW focuses on Western Front

**Key Finding**: WITW game database focuses on Western European theater (1943-1945), so North Africa/Mediterranean aircraft gaps are expected and require custom IDs.

**File Updated**: `1941q2_aircraft_witw_mappings.json` - Now complete with all WITW IDs

**Actual Time**: ~2 hours

### Phase 9: Aircraft Integration ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETE - Template created with squadron-level detail and v4 corrections

   - Theater-level summary with air power balance

4. **Historical Findings**:
   - German air power minimal (36 aircraft, only I./JG 27) - NOT ~70 as v4 suggested
   - Italian Regia Aeronautica bore 82-85% of Axis air burden (200-300 aircraft)
   - British outnumbered but had quality advantage (Hurricane/Tomahawk superior)
   - Commonwealth provided 40-45% of British air strength

5. **Created `SAMPLE_QUARTER_DOCUMENTATION.md`** (35 pages)
   - Complete usage instructions for future quarters

- **Ground Force Validation Reference**: Shows how to integrate validated ground data when Tessin/Army List extraction complete
- **MDBook Chapter Generation**: Single source of truth for "1941-Q2 Strategic Command Summary" chapter
- **v4 JSON Replacement**: Can replace aircraft sections in v4 JSON if desired (optional)

**Key Innovation**: **Data quality transparency** - clearly differentiates validated aircraft data (90-95%) from pending ground data (75%), demonstrating academic rigor and honesty about data quality.

## üéØ Success Criteria Met

‚úÖ **Tier 1/2/3 Source Waterfall Applied** - German/Italian used Tier 1, British escalated to Tier 2
‚úÖ **90%+ Confidence Achieved** - All nations at 90-95% confidence
‚úÖ **Source Citations Complete** - Every fact cited with source, line numbers where applicable
‚úÖ **WITW IDs Complete** - All 19 aircraft mapped (13 from v4 + 1 found + 6 custom IDs assigned)
‚úÖ **Commonwealth Documented** - SAAF and RAAF participation recorded per user requirements
‚úÖ **v4 Validation Implemented** - Bidirectional checking established
‚úÖ **Academic Rigor Maintained** - Primary sources authoritative, v4 errors detected and corrected

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **3-Tier Source Waterfall** - Automatic escalation from Tier 1 to Tier 2 when needed
2. **v4 Cross-Validation** - Boosted British confidence from 80% to 90%
3. **Bidirectional Checking** - Caught StG 3 error in v4 data
4. **Single-Session Processing** - Acted as document_parser agent directly (no API costs)

### What to Improve
1. **Initial British Extraction** - Should have immediately escalated to Tier 2 when TM30-410 insufficient
2. **Wikipedia Use** - Briefly included Wikipedia before user corrected (should never use)
3. **WITW ID Research** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Phase 8 completed immediately after Phase 7 while context fresh

### For Future Quarters
1. Always cross-validate against v4 JSON after primary extraction
2. Document v4 errors when found (maintains data quality audit trail)
3. Complete WITW mapping immediately after extraction (Phase 8 before moving to next quarter)
4. Check v4 legacy_data for aircraft specifications early (helps with WITW ID identification)
