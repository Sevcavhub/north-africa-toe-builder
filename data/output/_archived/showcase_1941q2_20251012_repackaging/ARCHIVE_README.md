# Archived: 1941-Q2 Showcase Attempt

**Archive Date:** 2025-10-12
**Archive Location:** `data/output/_archived/showcase_1941q2_20251012_repackaging/`
**Reason:** Repackaging of existing data instead of building new units from primary sources

---

## Problem

This session attempted to create a "showcase demonstration" of the project by **reusing previously-built unit data** to generate various output formats and demonstrations. This approach **defeats the core purpose of this project**: building NEW unit TO&E data from PRIMARY historical source documents through rigorous research and extraction.

### What Went Wrong

Instead of:
- ✓ Extracting data from Tessin Wehrmacht Encyclopedia
- ✓ Parsing British Army Lists for Commonwealth units
- ✓ Analyzing Italian OOB archives for Italian divisions
- ✓ Building units from scratch with source citations

The showcase session did:
- ✗ Took already-completed 1941-Q2 units from previous sessions
- ✗ Repackaged them into MDBook chapters
- ✗ Created aircraft integration templates using existing data
- ✗ Built battle correlations from completed units
- ✗ Generated "Phase 8-10" workflows beyond the actual 7-phase system

**This is just reformatting existing work, not doing actual historical research and unit building.**

## What Was Created

### 1. Root-Level Showcase Files (6 files, ~85KB)

- `1941-Q2_COMPLETE_SHOWCASE.md` (21KB) - Master showcase document describing invented 10-phase architecture
- `1941-Q2_PHASES_1-7_SUMMARY.md` (17KB) - Summary of phases using existing unit data
- `1941-Q2_VALIDATION_RESULTS.json` (13KB) - Validation of already-completed units
- `1941-Q2_AIRCRAFT_EXTRACTION.json` (2.4KB) - Aircraft data extraction attempt
- `1941-Q2_AIRCRAFT_TEMPLATE.json` (11KB) - Template for Phase 9 aircraft integration
- `1941-Q2_BATTLE_CORRELATIONS.json` (19KB) - Battle correlations for Operation Battleaxe/Tobruk

### 2. Aircraft Extraction Directory (13 files, ~256KB)

Complete workflow for "Phase 9" aircraft integration (not a current project priority):
- Aircraft templates and databases
- WITW mappings for aircraft
- RAF, Luftwaffe, Regia Aeronautica squadron data
- Cross-validation analysis
- Integration summaries and project status docs

**Files:**
- `1941-Q2_AIRCRAFT_TEMPLATE.json`
- `1941q2_aircraft_witw_mappings.json`
- `1941q2_north_africa_aircraft_database.json`
- `1941-Q2_SAMPLE_QUARTER_INTEGRATED.json`
- `AIRCRAFT_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md`
- `british_1941q2_raf_raw_facts.json`
- `CROSS_VALIDATION_ANALYSIS.md`
- `german_1941q2_luftwaffe_raw_facts.json`
- `italian_1941q2_regia_aeronautica_raw_facts.json`
- `PHASE_9_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- `SAMPLE_QUARTER_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`

### 3. MDBook Structure (22 files)

## Why This Approach Was Wrong

### Core Project Mission
This project exists to:
1. Extract detailed TO&E data from **primary historical sources**
2. Build **new units** with rigorous source citations
3. Calculate equipment distributions bottom-up (Squad → Theater)
4. Create **original research outputs** with historical accuracy

### What The Showcase Did Instead
- Repackaged existing completed units
- Created demonstration outputs without doing new research
- Invented extra workflow phases (8-10) not in the actual system
- Focused on format/presentation instead of data extraction
- Built aircraft workflows (not current priority)

### The Result
**Zero new units built from sources. Just reorganized existing work.**

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stay focused on unit building** - The core workflow is: source → research → extraction → JSON unit file
2. **Avoid premature demonstrations** - Build the data first, showcase later
3. **Follow the actual 7-phase system** - Don't invent extra phases for demo purposes
4. **Aircraft data is future work** - Focus on ground units from primary sources now
5. **Repackaging ≠ Research** - Moving data around isn't the same as extracting it from sources

---

## What Should Have Happened

A legitimate 1941-Q2 session should:

1. **Load project configuration** for 1941-Q2 quarter
2. **Identify incomplete units** (e.g., 1941-Q1 has 8 remaining)
3. **For each unit:**
   - Search Tessin/Army Lists/Italian archives
   - Extract commander, personnel, equipment data
   - Calculate totals and validate
   - Generate JSON unit file with source citations
   - Create MDBook chapter from unit JSON
4. **Checkpoint after batch** (Ken's 3-3-3 rule)
5. **Repeat until quarter complete**

**This actually builds NEW data instead of repackaging OLD data.**

## Manual Cleanup Required

**⚠️ ACTION NEEDED:**

The directory `data/output/north-africa-book/` is locked by Windows and couldn't be deleted automatically. It has been **copied to this archive** successfully.

**To complete cleanup:**
1. Close any File Explorer windows showing `data/output/`
2. Close any IDE windows or processes accessing that directory
3. Manually delete: `data/output/north-africa-book/`

The directory is already preserved in this archive, so deletion is safe.

## Archive Integrity

All files successfully archived:
- ✅ 6 root-level files moved
- ✅ `aircraft_extraction/` directory moved (13 files)
- ✅ `north-africa-book/` directory copied (22 files) - **original needs manual deletion**

**Archive is complete and can be referenced if needed.**
