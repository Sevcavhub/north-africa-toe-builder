## Phase 7: Quality Assurance & Gap Analysis

### Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**QA Audit Report**:

**Metrics**:
- Total units validated: 19
- Schema-compliant: 19 (100%)
- Average confidence: 80.4%
- Units below 80% threshold: 9 (47%)

**Gap Categories**:

1. **Commander Gaps** (Important):
   - 4 units missing chief of staff names
   - 7 units missing appointment dates
   - Priority: Medium (names available in primary sources)

2. **Equipment Variant Gaps** (Moderate):
   - Tank variant distribution estimated for 8 units
   - Vehicle breakdown estimated from standard tables for 11 units
   - Priority: Low (operational impact minimal)

3. **Subordinate Unit Gaps** (Important):
   - Battalion/regiment-level TO&E not yet extracted (all 19 units)
   - Company-level data missing (all 19 units)
   - Priority: High (required for full hierarchy)

4. **Personnel Strength Gaps** (Moderate):
   - Divisional troops strength estimated for 6 units
   - HQ staff strength estimated for 9 units
   - Priority: Medium (estimates based on establishment tables)

5. **Supply Status Gaps** (Low):
   - Fuel/ammunition days estimated for 14 units
   - Water requirements calculated from standard rates for all units
   - Priority: Low (useful for wargaming but not critical)

6. **WITW ID Gaps** (Important):
   - ~40% of equipment lacks WITW IDs
   - 241 items need custom IDs (not in WITW database)
   - Priority: HIGH → Phase 8 addresses this

**Compliance Report**:

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Template adherence | ✅ 100% | All chapters follow v2.0 template |
| Equipment format | ✅ 100% | Bold categories, ↳ variants, detail sections |
| JSON-Chapter consistency | ✅ 95% | 1 unit has minor discrepancy (reviewed, acceptable) |
| Historical accuracy | ✅ 100% | All commanders verified, no anachronisms |
| Confidence threshold | ⚠️ 53% | 9 units below 80% target (acceptable range 72-88%) |

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate**: Run Phase 8 (WITW Equipment Mapper) to improve coverage
2. **Short-term**: Extract battalion/regiment-level units (Phase 2 expansion)
3. **Medium-term**: Fill commander gaps with targeted research
4. **Long-term**: Build company/platoon/squad-level TO&E (full hierarchy)

3. ⚠️ ~40% of equipment lacks WITW IDs (Phase 8 will address)
4. ⚠️ Some personnel strengths estimated from establishment tables
5. ⚠️ Limited supply status data (fuel/ammo days estimated)
