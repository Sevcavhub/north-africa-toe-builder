The division comprised two armoured brigades: 2nd Armoured Brigade (Queen's Bays, 9th Lancers, 10th Hussars) and 22nd Armoured Brigade (2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, 3rd and 4th County of London Yeomanry). Support Group included 2 RHA with 25-pounders, anti-tank and anti-aircraft regiments, engineers, and infantry. Division arrived too late for Operation Crusader initial fighting, underwent desert training in November-December, and moved to front line in early January 1942. Reinforced with 200th Guards Brigade by end of year. Overall confidence: 78% - strong data on command, deployment, tank types and brigade structure; gaps in precise personnel numbers and some support unit designations."
