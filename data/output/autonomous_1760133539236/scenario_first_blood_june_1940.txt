WITW SCENARIO: FIRST BLOOD - WESTERN DESERT, JUNE 1940
================================================================================

SCENARIO METADATA
-----------------
Name: First Blood - Western Desert Border Operations
Theater: North Africa - Western Desert
Date: 11-14 June 1940
Duration: 4 turns (1 turn = 1 day)
Map Size: 40km x 30km
Terrain: Desert, coastal plain, limited settlements
Historical Context: First British offensive action after Italy's declaration of war

HISTORICAL SUMMARY
------------------
On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France. The very next day,
elements of the British 7th Armoured Division's reconnaissance forces (11th
Hussars) crossed the border from Egypt into Libya, initiating the first combat
operations of the Western Desert Campaign. The Italian 27ª Divisione "Brescia"
was tasked with coastal defense and border security in the Zawiya sector.

This scenario recreates the initial border skirmishes as British armoured car
patrols probed Italian defensive positions, taking prisoners and testing enemy
resolve. Historically, the 11th Hussars captured 70 Italian prisoners on 11 June.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
------------------
BRITISH:
- MAJOR VICTORY: Capture 100+ Italian prisoners, destroy 10+ vehicles, no British
  losses > 15 vehicles
- MINOR VICTORY: Capture 50+ prisoners, destroy 5+ vehicles, maintain reconnaissance
  screen
- DRAW: Both sides achieve objectives partially
- DEFEAT: British losses > 20 vehicles or fail to capture any objectives

ITALIAN:
- MAJOR VICTORY: Destroy 20+ British vehicles, maintain all defensive positions
- MINOR VICTORY: Destroy 10+ British vehicles, force British withdrawal
- DRAW: Both sides achieve objectives partially
- DEFEAT: Lose 100+ prisoners or allow British penetration > 20km

================================================================================
MAP SETUP
================================================================================

TERRAIN FEATURES
----------------
- COASTAL ROAD: Runs east-west, primary route (hard surface)
- DESERT: Open terrain, minimal vegetation
- RIDGELINES: 2-3 low ridges provide observation/defensive positions
- ZAWIYA SETTLEMENT: Italian HQ and supply depot (6km from border)
- BORDER MARKERS: Wire fence, occasional posts
- WADIS: 3-4 dry riverbeds, provide concealment

DEPLOYMENT ZONES
----------------
BRITISH:
- Start: Egyptian side of border (off-map east edge)
- Entry: Turn 1, anywhere along eastern map edge
- Objective: Penetrate 10-20km into Libya, engage Italian forces

ITALIAN:
- Primary Defense Line: 3-6km west of border along ridgeline
- Mobile Reserve: Zawiya area (central map)
- Artillery: Off-map west edge
- Special: May place minefields (3 hexes) and wire (5 hexes)

SUPPLY LINES
------------
British: 240km from Mersa Matruh (extended but functional)
Italian: 85km from Tripoli via coastal road (good)

================================================================================
SPECIAL SCENARIO RULES
================================================================================

DESERT WARFARE
--------------
1. NAVIGATION: Both sides may use sun compasses. British have +1 bonus to
   navigation checks due to experience.

2. WATER: Each unit must maintain 6-10 liters/day per man. Movement > 30km
   from water source = -1 morale.

3. MECHANICAL RELIABILITY:
   - British vehicles: 5% breakdown per 50km
   - Italian vehicles: 8% breakdown per 50km
   - Breakdowns repairable with maintenance turn

4. VISIBILITY: Excellent in desert (up to 20km), dust clouds reveal movement

RECONNAISSANCE DOCTRINE
-----------------------
1. BRITISH OBJECTIVES:
   - Locate and identify Italian positions
   - Capture prisoners for intelligence
   - Avoid decisive engagement with main Italian forces
   - Establish forward observation posts

2. ITALIAN OBJECTIVES:
   - Hold defensive positions
   - Deny British reconnaissance
   - Preserve forces for future defensive operations
   - Protect Zawiya supply depot

PRISONER CAPTURE
----------------
- Infantry in open terrain surrenders if reduced to <50% strength and isolated
- Vehicle crews surrender if vehicle immobilized and isolated
- British receive +2 VP per 10 prisoners captured
- Italian receive +2 VP per prisoner recovered/prevented

RADIO COMMUNICATION
-------------------
- British: Excellent radio communication, coordinated movement
- Italian: Limited radio, some units rely on motorcycle dispatch
- Effect: British reaction time 50% faster

HISTORICAL NOTES
================================================================================

ACTUAL OUTCOME (11-14 June 1940):
---------------------------------
The 11th Hussars crossed the border on 11 June and immediately encountered
Italian positions. In the first engagement, they captured 70 Italian prisoners
from the Brescia Division without suffering losses. Over the next three days,
British patrols ranged deep into Libya, capturing Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Omar
before withdrawing to prepared positions in Egypt.

The Italian response was cautious - Generale Cremascoli ordered his division to
remain in defensive positions rather than pursue the British raiders. This
established a pattern that would continue: British aggression and mobility versus
Italian static defense.

VARIANT SCENARIOS
-----------------
1. "Limited Engagement": Reduce British forces to 1 squadron (15 armoured cars)
2. "Italian Counterattack": Allow Italian L3/35 battalion to pursue British
3. "Extended Raid": 7-turn scenario with Fort Capuzzo as objective
4. "Night Patrol": 2-turn night scenario, reduced visibility

EQUIPMENT NOTES
---------------
- Morris CS9: Effective reconnaissance vehicle, vulnerable to any anti-tank weapon
- L3/35 Tankette: Obsolete by 1940, ineffective against anything but infantry
- Boys Anti-Tank Rifle: Can penetrate L3/35 armor at 300m
- 47/32 AT Gun: Adequate against light armour, struggles with cruiser tanks

LESSONS LEARNED
---------------
For British: Importance of reconnaissance in desert warfare, mobility advantage
For Italian: Need for mobile reserves, inadequate anti-tank weapons, poor
communications hindered response

================================================================================
DESIGNER NOTES
================================================================================

This scenario is designed to introduce players to Western Desert warfare
mechanics in War in the West. Key learning points:

1. RECONNAISSANCE VALUE: British players learn importance of information gathering
2. DEFENSIVE POSITIONS: Italian players must balance static defense vs. mobility
3. DESERT MOVEMENT: Both sides experience desert navigation and supply challenges
4. COMBINED ARMS: Coordination between armoured cars, infantry, and artillery

BALANCE: Scenario is intentionally British-favored to reflect historical
superiority in training, equipment quality, and tactical doctrine. Italian
players must focus on preservation of forces and delaying actions rather than
seeking decisive victory.

REPLAYABILITY: Variable British entry points and Italian defensive deployments
create different tactical situations each game.
