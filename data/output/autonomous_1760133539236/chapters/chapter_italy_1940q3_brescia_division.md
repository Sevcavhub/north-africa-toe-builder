|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 7 | Low |
| Ammunition | 14 | Low |
| Food | 15 | Adequate |
| Water | 29800 L/day | Minimal |

**Assessment**: Coastal defense posture, limited offensive operations expected

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Coastal defense and security operations along Tunisian-Libyan border

**Special Capabilities**:
- Truck-moveable (autotrasportabile) for rapid repositioning
- Desert-adapted with specialized vehicles (SPA AS.37 Sahariano)
- Limited mechanization compared to full motorized divisions

**Known Issues**:
- Insufficient motor transport for full division movement simultaneously
- Dependent on corps-level transport assets for sustained mobility
- Limited anti-tank capability (only 8 x 47mm guns)
- Weak anti-aircraft defense (only 4 x 20mm guns)
- Binary structure reduces combat power compared to pre-1939 ternary divisions

**Desert Adaptations**: Equipped with SPA AS.37 Sahariano desert vehicles, increased water transport capacity, light uniform and equipment modifications

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 6/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Autotrasportabile: May be moved by truck if transport allocated by higher command
- Desert Acclimatized: No penalties for desert operations
- Coastal Defense: +1 when in prepared defensive positions
- Supply Dependent: -1 morale if out of supply for more than 2 turns

**Suitable Scenarios**:
