|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 3 | Critical |
| Ammunition | 5 | Critical |
| Food | 7 | Low |
| Water | 73150 L/day | Adequate |

**Assessment**: Initial Operation Torch logistics capacity, improved after port capture

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: First US heavy armored division to see combat. Designed for breakthrough operations and exploitation with concentrated armor mass.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Combined arms operations with integral artillery and infantry
- Mobile firepower concentration
- Rapid exploitation capability
- Self-contained logistics for 3-5 day operations

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Combat Command system for flexible task organization
- Integration of M7 Priest self-propelled artillery for mobile fire support
- Tank-infantry-artillery coordination at battalion level

**Known Issues**:
- Division did not deploy as single entity for Operation Torch - elements scattered
- M3 Lee tank design limitations (high silhouette, sponson-mounted 75mm)
- Limited desert warfare experience and training
- Logistical challenges in North African terrain
- Vulnerability to German 88mm anti-tank guns

**Desert Adaptations**: Limited pre-deployment desert modifications. Sand shields and air filters added in theater. Water storage increased. Desert camouflage applied after arrival.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 7/10
**Experience Level**: Green

**Special Rules**:
- First Combat: -1 to initiative rolls in first 3 scenarios
- Learning Curve: Experience level improves to Regular after 5 combat engagements
- M3 Lee Limitations: -1 to close combat due to high silhouette
- Dispersed Deployment: For Operation Torch scenarios, only partial division available
- Combined Arms Doctrine: +1 when tank, infantry, and artillery units coordinate

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Operation Torch landings (November 1942)
- Tunisia Campaign (late 1942 - early 1943)
- Kasserine Pass (February 1943)
- Combined arms training scenarios
- US vs German armored engagements
