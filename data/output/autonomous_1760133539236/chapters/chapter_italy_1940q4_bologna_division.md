## Supply Status

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 10 | Low |
| Ammunition | 15 | Adequate |
| Food | 20 | Adequate |
| Water | 54890 L/day | Adequate |

**Assessment**: Limited by desert supply lines from Tripoli. Water supply critical in desert environment.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Standard infantry division for defensive and limited offensive operations in North African theater. Auto-transportable designation allows movement by motor transport but not simultaneous transport of all elements.

**Special Capabilities**:
- Desert operations experience
- Light tank battalion provides limited mobile firepower
- Eliminated pack animals in favor of motor transport (AS type)
- Enhanced mobility compared to metropolitan divisions

**Tactical Innovations**:
- AS (Africa Settentrionale) organization optimized for North African operations
- Integrated light tank battalion at division level
- Motorized support structure for desert mobility

**Known Issues**:
- Light tanks (L3/35) inadequate against British armor
- Limited anti-tank capability (47/32mm insufficient vs. Matilda)
- Dependent on vulnerable supply lines from Tripoli
- Water supply critical constraint
- Infantry equipment inferior to British Commonwealth forces
- Carcano rifle range/accuracy inferior to Lee-Enfield
- Breda M30 LMG reliability issues in desert conditions

**Desert Adaptations**: AS-type organization with no pack animals, enhanced motor transport, integrated water supply company, desert camouflage patterns. Stationed at Bir al-Ghanam southwest of Tripoli.

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

**Theater**: North Africa - Libya (Tripolitania)/Egypt border region

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 6/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Vulnerable to British armor
- Water supply critical (reduce effectiveness if water scarce)
- L3/35 tankettes ineffective vs. armored vehicles
- Breda M30 reliability: -1 to LMG effectiveness in prolonged combat
- Good defensive fighters in prepared positions
- Morale penalty if isolated from supply

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940)
- Operation Compass defense (December 1940)
- Frontier defensive operations
- Desert patrol actions
- Supply convoy escort/raids
