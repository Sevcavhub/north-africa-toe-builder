Supply base at Mersa Matruh, forward dumps along Egyptian frontier

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Mobile armoured division for desert warfare - reconnaissance in force, defensive operations, and rapid response to Italian incursions

**Special Capabilities**:
- Desert navigation and long-range patrolling
- Armoured car reconnaissance (11th Hussars)
- Integrated combined arms operations
- Mobile defensive tactics

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Use of armoured cars for deep reconnaissance
- Support Group pivot concept (artillery + motorized infantry)
- Radio communication for coordinated movement

**Known Issues**:
- Severe tank shortage (65 actual vs 340 authorized)
- Light tanks obsolete against Italian M13/40
- Limited spare parts and maintenance facilities
- 8 cruiser tanks without anti-tank guns
- Extended supply lines from Mersa Matruh

**Desert Adaptations**: ['Sun compasses for navigation', 'Condensers for water conservation', 'Sand filters for engines', 'Special fuel mixtures for desert conditions']

## Critical Equipment Shortages

### Priority 1: Critical Shortages (Mission-Limiting)

- Severe tank shortage (65 actual vs 340 authorized)
- Limited spare parts and maintenance facilities

**Overall Assessment**: Equipment shortages limited operational capability during this quarter. Units adapted through tactical innovation and aggressive use of available resources.
