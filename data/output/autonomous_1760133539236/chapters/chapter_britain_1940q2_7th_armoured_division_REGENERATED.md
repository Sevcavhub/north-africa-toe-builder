# 7th Armoured Division "Desert Rats"

**British Empire Forces • 1940 Q2 (April-June) • Western Desert, Egypt**

---

## Division Overview

The 7th Armoured Division, immortalized as the "Desert Rats," was formed from the Mobile Division (Egypt) on 16 February 1940. Originally established on 27 September 1938 as Britain's first mobile armoured formation specifically designed for desert warfare, the division was training and building strength when Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940. Within 24 hours, elements of the division crossed into Libya and drew first blood, taking 70 Italian prisoners on 11 June 1940.

The division adopted its famous jerboa (desert rat) insignia on 16 April 1940, symbolizing its adaptation to the harsh desert environment. The jerboa, a small nocturnal rodent native to North African deserts, represented the division's agility, endurance, and ability to survive in extreme conditions. This insignia would become one of the most recognizable unit symbols of the Second World War.

During the second quarter of 1940, the 7th Armoured Division held defensive positions along the Egyptian-Libyan frontier, conducting reconnaissance patrols and preparing for potential Italian aggression. Despite severe equipment shortages—particularly in tanks and anti-tank guns—the division began developing the tactics and desert expertise that would make it legendary in the coming campaigns.
