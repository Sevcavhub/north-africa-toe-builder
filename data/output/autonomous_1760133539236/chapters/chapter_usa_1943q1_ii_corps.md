## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Corps-level command and control for ground operations in Tunisia

**Special Capabilities**:
- Combined arms coordination (armor, infantry, artillery)
- Multi-division maneuver warfare
- Desert operations experience
- Integration with Allied forces (British, French)

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Learning from Kasserine Pass defeat
- Improved armor-infantry coordination under Patton
- Enhanced reconnaissance and intelligence gathering
- Better anti-tank tactics against German panzers

**Known Issues**:
- Inexperienced leadership initially (Fredendall)
- Poor coordination at Kasserine Pass (Feb 1943)
- Inadequate anti-tank weapons (37mm ineffective)
- Green troops facing veteran German forces
- Dispersed defensive positions early in campaign

**Desert Adaptations**: Standard US equipment adaptations for desert terrain - dust filters, increased water capacity, modified maintenance schedules

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

**Theater**: North Africa - Tunisia Campaign

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 7/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Patton Leadership Bonus (post March 6, 1943): +1 to initiative
- Green Troops Penalty (early Q1): -1 to first combat engagement
- Superior Logistics: +2 to supply availability
- Allied Air Superiority: +1 to artillery spotting
- Kasserine Lessons Learned (post Feb 25): +1 to defensive coordination

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Battle of Kasserine Pass (Feb 19-25, 1943)
- Battle of El Guettar (March 23-April 7, 1943)
- Final Tunisia Campaign offensive (April-May 1943)
- Learning curve scenarios - green vs veteran forces

## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Confidence Score**: 80% (High)

**Data Sources**:
- 1943-Q1_Enhanced_COMPREHENSIVE_v4.json - US forces data
- FM 17-10 Armored Force Field Manual 1942
- FM 7-20 Infantry Battalion Field Manual 1942
- FM 101-10 US Army Staff Manual 1941
- British Military History - Tunisia 1942-1943 US Divisions
- National WWII Museum - US II Corps at El Guettar
- Historical records - II Corps operations Tunisia

**Known Gaps**:
- Exact corps headquarters staff breakdown requires additional research
- Some subordinate unit TO&E details need division-level extraction
- Tank operational rates estimated from battle reports
- Aircraft support was theater-level, not organic to corps
- Detailed anti-aircraft battery assignments require further research

## Conclusion

The II Corps represents a significant American formation in North Africa during 1943-Q1. This TO&E provides a comprehensive snapshot of the unit's organization, equipment, and capabilities during this period.
