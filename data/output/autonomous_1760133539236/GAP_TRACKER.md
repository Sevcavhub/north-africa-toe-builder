## Pattern Analysis

### Common Gap Patterns

1. **WITW IDs Missing** (~250 instances)
   - **Pattern:** Affects all 18 units
   - **Severity:** Low (wargaming reference only, not historical)
   - **Resolution:** Defer until historical data complete, then cross-reference with WITW database

2. **Commander Names** (12 instances, 7 units)
   - **Pattern:** Most common at brigade/regimental level
   - **Affected Nations:** British (4), Italian (5), French (2), German (1)
   - **Severity:** Important
   - **Resolution:** Need Army Lists / organizational rosters for specific quarters

3. **Equipment Variant Distribution** (15 instances, 8 units)
   - **Pattern:** When multiple variants exist, exact allocation by sub-unit unclear
   - **Example:** "50 tanks total: 30x Panzer III Ausf G, 20x Ausf H - but which company gets which?"
   - **Severity:** Important
   - **Resolution:** Need battalion/company-level TO&E documents or war diaries

4. **Subordinate Unit Details** (8 instances, 5 units)
   - **Pattern:** Division-level data solid, but regiment‚Üíbattalion‚Üícompany hierarchy incomplete
   - **Affected Nations:** Italian (3), British (2)
   - **Severity:** Important
   - **Resolution:** Need lower-level organizational documents

5. **Supply Status Incomplete** (3 instances, 3 units)
   - **Pattern:** Fuel/ammo/water estimates present but not precise
   - **Severity:** Moderate
   - **Resolution:** Need supply reports / war diaries for specific quarters
