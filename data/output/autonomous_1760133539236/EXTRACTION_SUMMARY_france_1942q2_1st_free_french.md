## Historical Context

### Formation
The 1st Free French Brigade was reorganized from the 1st Light Free French Division in **December 1941** to conform to British military organization. It was assigned to the British 8th Army for operations in North Africa.

### Battle of Bir Hakeim (26 May - 11 June 1942)

- Defended the southern anchor of the Gazala Line
- Held position against Rommel's Afrika Korps for **16 days**
- Faced assault by 5 Axis divisions
- **2,700 of 3,700** troops successfully evacuated after ordered withdrawal on 11 June 1942
- Delayed Axis offensive, enabling British forces to regroup

### Significance
- Demonstrated Free French military capability
- Restored French military honor after 1940 defeat
- Earned respect from British allies and international recognition
- Contributed decisively to saving British army in retreat

### Later Organization
The 1st Free French Brigade was later combined with other Free French formations to create the **1st Free French Division (1e DFL)** on **1 February 1943**.

## Methodology

### Source Selection
Used **3-Tier Waterfall** approach:
- **Tier 1:** British Army Lists searched - No Free French entries found (not formally part of British Army)
- **Tier 2:** Curated web sources (National WWII Museum, World History Encyclopedia, academic sources)
- **Tier 3:** General search not needed - Tier 2 provided comprehensive coverage

### Data Compilation
1. Cross-referenced multiple historical accounts of Bir Hakeim battle
2. Verified equipment counts from detailed order of battle documentation
3. Estimated personnel breakdown using standard French TO&E ratios
4. Calculated vehicle counts from British supply records and battle inventories
5. Preserved French terminology for unit designations (as per project requirements)

### Confidence Calculation
Weighted average based on:
- Source quality (Tier 2 sources, academic/museum quality)
- Cross-verification (multiple sources confirm key facts)
- Specificity of data (detailed equipment inventories from Bir Hakeim siege documentation)
- Known gaps (truck models, some commander names)

## Conclusion

Successfully extracted comprehensive TO&E for **1re Brigade Française Libre** for 1942-Q2 with **82% confidence**.
