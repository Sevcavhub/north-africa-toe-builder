## Armoured Strength

### Summary

The division faced a **critical tank shortage** in Q2 1940, possessing only **228 tanks** versus an authorized War Establishment of **340 tanks** - just **67% of authorized strength**.

| Category | Total | Operational | Readiness |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **All Tanks** | **228** | **220** | **96.5%** |
| Medium Tanks (Cruisers) | 69 | 66 | 95.7% |
| Light Tanks | 159 | 152 | 95.6% |
| Heavy Tanks | 0 | 0 | N/A |

### Medium Tanks (Cruiser Tanks)

#### A13 Mk II (Cruiser Mk IV) - 44 tanks

The backbone of British cruiser strength, the **A13 Mk II** equipped the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment with its superior speed and mobility.

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40mm)
- **Armor**: 30mm frontal
- **Speed**: 48 km/h (fast for 1940)
- **Crew**: 4 (commander, gunner, loader, driver)
- **Operational Rate**: 42/44 (95.5%)

**Combat Performance**:
The A13's high speed made it ideal for mobile desert operations, but its light armor (30mm) and 40mm gun would prove inadequate against heavily-armored Italian M13/40 medium tanks and German Panzers arriving in 1941.

---

#### A10 Cruiser Mk II - 10 tanks

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40mm)
- **Armor**: 30mm frontal
- **Speed**: 26 km/h (slower "heavy cruiser")
- **Crew**: 5
- **Operational Rate**: 10/10 (100%)

**Notes**: The A10 was designed as an "infantry tank" but reclassified as a "heavy cruiser." Its additional armor came at the cost of mobility.

---

#### A9 Cruiser Mk I - 9 tanks

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40mm)
- **Armor**: 14mm frontal (very light)
- **Speed**: 40 km/h
- **Crew**: 6 (including two sub-turret machine gunners)
- **Operational Rate**: 8/9 (88.9%)

**Combat Issues**: The A9's thin armor (14mm) made it extremely vulnerable. By January 1940, the 6th RTR operated a mix of 23 A9/A10 cruisers.

---

#### Matilda II Infantry Tank - 6 tanks

The 7th Royal Tank Regiment deployed a **small initial force** of the heavily-armored **Matilda II** - Britain's most formidable tank in 1940.

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40mm)
- **Armor**: 77mm frontal (excellent for 1940)
- **Speed**: 24 km/h (slow but well-protected)
- **Crew**: 4
- **Operational Rate**: 6/6 (100%)

**Historical Significance**: The Matilda II's heavy armor would prove devastating against Italian forces during Operation Compass (December 1940), as Italian anti-tank guns could not penetrate its 77mm frontal armor.

---

### Light Tanks

#### Light Tank Mk VI - 159 tanks

The division's **most numerous tank**, the **Mk VI light tank** equipped the cavalry regiments for reconnaissance. However, it was **obsolete for combat** against any medium tank.

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: .303 Vickers machine gun + .50 Vickers machine gun
- **Armor**: 14mm (maximum)
- **Speed**: 56 km/h (fastest tank in the division)
- **Crew**: 3
- **Operational Rate**: 152/159 (95.6%)

**Role**: Reconnaissance only. The Mk VI's machine-gun armament and thin armor made it useless against Italian M13/40 medium tanks armed with 47mm guns.

## Organizational Structure

The 7th Armoured Division fielded **three brigades** with distinct roles:

### 1. 4th Armoured Brigade

**Type**: Heavy Armoured Brigade (renamed from "4th Heavy Armoured Brigade" on 14 April 1940)
**Commander**: Brigadier J. A. L. Caunter
**Strength**: 2,500 personnel
**Headquarters**: Abbassia

**Composition**:
- **6th Royal Tank Regiment** (850 men) - A9/A10 cruiser tanks + Mk VI light tanks
- **7th Queen's Own Hussars** (800 men) - Mk VI light tanks
- **1st Royal Horse Artillery** (450 men) - 25-pounder guns

**Historical Note**: The 6th RTR reached full tank establishment by January 1940 with 23 A9/A10 cruisers.

---

### 2. 7th Armoured Brigade

**Type**: Light Armoured Brigade (renamed from "7th Light Armoured Brigade" on 14 April 1940)
**Commander**: Unknown
**Strength**: 2,500 personnel
**Headquarters**: Western Desert

**Composition**:
- **7th Hussars** (800 men) - Mk VI light tanks
- **8th King's Royal Irish Hussars** (800 men) - Mk VI light tanks
- **11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own)** (650 men) - Morris CS9 and Rolls-Royce armoured cars

**Historical Significance**: The **11th Hussars** were the division's eyes and ears - their armoured car patrols ranged hundreds of kilometers into the desert, providing invaluable reconnaissance. On **11 June 1940**, they became the first British unit to engage Italian forces, capturing 70 prisoners.

---

### 3. 7th Support Group

**Type**: Support Group (Artillery + Motorized Infantry)
**Commander**: Brigadier W. H. E. Gott
**Strength**: 4,600 personnel
**Headquarters**: Western Desert
**Formed**: 22 January 1940

**Artillery**:
- **16x Ordnance QF 25-pounder** field guns
- **24x Ordnance QF 2-pounder** anti-tank guns
- **24x Bofors 40mm** anti-aircraft guns

**Infantry**:

**Supply Base**: Mersa Matruh, with forward dumps along Egyptian-Libyan frontier
**Assessment**: Adequate reserves for defensive operations. Supply lines extended but manageable.

---

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

### Role

Mobile armoured division for **desert warfare** - reconnaissance in force, defensive operations, and rapid response to Italian incursions along the Egyptian-Libyan frontier.

### Special Capabilities

1. **Desert Navigation & Long-Range Patrolling**
   Sun compasses, desert-experienced drivers, and navigation specialists enabled operations hundreds of kilometers from base.

2. **Armoured Car Reconnaissance (11th Hussars)**
   Deep penetration reconnaissance patrols provided early warning and intelligence on Italian dispositions.

3. **Integrated Combined Arms Operations**
   The Support Group concept pioneered the integration of artillery, motorized infantry, and armor in mobile operations.

4. **Mobile Defensive Tactics**
   Rather than static defense, the division employed mobile "boxes" - defensive positions anchored by artillery with armored counterattack capability.

### Tactical Innovations

- **Armoured cars for deep reconnaissance** - The 11th Hussars' long-range patrols became legendary
- **Support Group "pivot" concept** - Artillery + motorized infantry as mobile defensive anchor
- **Radio communication for dispersed formations** - Wireless coordination enabled operations across vast distances

### Desert Adaptations

- **Sun compasses** for navigation (magnetic compasses unreliable in desert)
- **Engine condensers** for water conservation
- **Sand filters** for engines
- **Special fuel mixtures** for extreme heat

## Critical Equipment Shortages

### 1. Tank Shortage: **65 cruisers vs 340 authorized (19% strength)**

The division's most critical weakness was the **severe shortage of cruiser tanks**. War Office records from April 1940 documented only **65 cruiser tanks** operational versus **340 authorized** - an **81% shortfall**.

**Impact**: The division could not sustain offensive operations or replace combat losses. Armoured brigades operated far below establishment strength.

### 2. Obsolete Light Tanks

The 159 **Light Tank Mk VI** vehicles were obsolete for combat:
- Machine-gun armament useless against medium tanks
- 14mm armor penetrated by all Italian anti-tank guns
- Relegated to reconnaissance role only

### 3. Anti-Tank Gun Shortage

Some cruiser tanks (8 vehicles) lacked anti-tank guns due to production shortages. These tanks could only engage soft targets.

### 4. Extended Supply Lines

The division operated **240 km from Mersa Matruh**, stretching logistics across desert terrain with limited transport capacity.

## Historical Context: Q2 1940

### Key Events

**14 April 1940**: Armoured brigades officially drop "heavy" and "light" designations, becoming simply "4th Armoured Brigade" and "7th Armoured Brigade."

**16 April 1940**: The division adopts the **jerboa (desert rat) insignia**, confirmed officially in May 1940. The jerboa was chosen for its desert survival abilities and became one of the most famous military insignias in history.

**10 June 1940**: **Italy declares war** on Britain and France. The Western Desert immediately becomes an active theater.

**11 June 1940**: **First combat action** - 11th Hussars armoured cars and 1st Battalion KRRC cross into Libya, engage Italian forces, capture **70 prisoners**. First blood to the Desert Rats.

**17 June 1940**: **Western Desert Force** formed under Major-General Richard O'Connor, with 7th Armoured Division as its mobile striking force.

### Operational Status

**Posture**: Defensive operations along the Egyptian-Libyan frontier
**Mission**: Border patrol, reconnaissance, harassment of Italian probes
**Combat Activity**: Limited border skirmishing following Italian declaration of war

**Equipment Status**:
- **Critical tank shortage**: 65 cruisers vs 340 authorized (19%)
- Limited spare parts for older tank models
- Supply buildup ongoing from Mersa Matruh

## Conclusion

The **7th Armoured Division** in Q2 1940 was a formation in transition - pioneering desert mobile warfare doctrine while struggling with critical equipment shortages. With only **19% of authorized cruiser tank strength**, the division could not sustain offensive operations. Yet its innovative combined-arms tactics, superb reconnaissance capabilities (11th Hussars), and experienced commanders would prove decisive in the coming months.

By December 1940, after reinforcement and operational experience, this same division would spearhead **Operation Compass** - Britain's first major offensive of WWII - destroying 10 Italian divisions and advancing 800 kilometers in two months. The "Desert Rats" legend was born on the Egyptian frontier in June 1940.
