| Water | 150000 L/day | Adequate |

**Assessment**: Initial deployment supply levels, critical fuel and ammunition shortages throughout North Africa campaign

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Mobile armored division for exploitation of breakthrough, counter-penetration, and mobile reserve

**Special Capabilities**:
- Rapid deployment and maneuver in open desert terrain
- Combined arms coordination with German Afrika Korps
- Motorized/mechanized all units for sustained mobile operations

**Tactical Innovations**:
- Italian adaptation of German panzer division doctrine
- Mixed light and medium tank employment
- Integrated Bersaglieri motorized infantry support

**Known Issues**:
- L3/35 light tanks severely undergunned and under-armored for 1941 combat
- M13/40 medium tanks inferior to British cruiser and Matilda tanks
- Chronic fuel and ammunition supply shortages
- Limited tank maintenance and recovery capabilities in desert
- Radio equipment insufficient for coordinated tank operations

**Desert Adaptations**: Division trained for desert warfare, vehicles equipped with sand filters, extra water and fuel capacity, desert camouflage applied to vehicles

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 7/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Italian Armor Doctrine: -1 initiative when operating independently, +0 when coordinated with German units
- L3/35 Tankettes: Ineffective vs armor, effective vs infantry
- Desert Supply Crisis: Roll supply check each scenario turn, failure = -1 combat effectiveness
- Bersaglieri Elite: 8th Bersaglieri Regiment counts as Veteran experience

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Operation Sonnenblume (March-April 1941)
- First Battle of Tobruk (April-May 1941)
- Operation Crusader (November 1941)
- Bir el Gubi engagement (19 November 1941)

- Exact allocation of 47/32 antitank guns across Bersaglieri battalions vs antitank company
- AA battery allocation: sources indicate 20mm AA guns added later in 1941, zero allocated Q1
