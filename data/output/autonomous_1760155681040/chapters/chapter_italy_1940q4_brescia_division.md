## Supply Status

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Fuel | 8 | Low |
| Ammunition | 16 | Adequate |
| Food | 18 | Adequate |
| Water | 30080 L/day | Minimal |

**Assessment**: Coastal defense posture west of Tripoli, improved logistics from Q3, anticipating British offensive

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: Coastal defense operations west of Tripoli, reserve for potential Western Desert operations

**Special Capabilities**:
- Truck-moveable (autotrasportabile) for rapid repositioning
- Desert-adapted with specialized vehicles (SPA AS.37 Sahariano)
- Limited mechanization compared to full motorized divisions
- Positioned for potential deployment to support 10th Army

**Known Issues**:
- Insufficient motor transport for full division movement simultaneously
- Dependent on corps-level transport assets for sustained mobility
- Limited anti-tank capability (only 8 x 47mm guns)
- Weak anti-aircraft defense (only 4 x 20mm guns)
- Binary structure reduces combat power compared to pre-1939 ternary divisions
- Not engaged in Operation Compass initial phase (Dec 1940) but on alert status

**Desert Adaptations**: Equipped with SPA AS.37 Sahariano desert vehicles, increased water transport capacity, light uniform and equipment modifications for coastal/desert operations

## Critical Equipment Shortages

*Data to be updated from detailed operational reports.*

## Historical Context

Historical context data not available.

## Wargaming Data

**Morale Rating**: 6/10
**Experience Level**: Regular

**Special Rules**:
- Autotrasportabile: May be moved by truck if transport allocated by higher command
- Desert Acclimatized: No penalties for desert operations
- Coastal Defense: +1 when in prepared defensive positions
- Supply Dependent: -1 morale if out of supply for more than 2 turns
- Reserve Status Q4 1940: Not in frontline contact during Operation Compass opening

**Suitable Scenarios**:
- Western Desert 1940-Q4
- Operation Compass reserve scenarios
- Coastal defense west of Tripoli
- North Africa late 1940
- Italian defensive positions December 1940
