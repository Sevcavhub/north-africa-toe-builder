# 55ª Divisione di Fanteria "Savona"

**Italian Forces • 1940 Q4 (October-December) • Gharyan, Libya**

---

## Division Overview

The 55th Infantry Division "Savona" was a binary infantry division of the Royal Italian Army (Regio Esercito) serving as a garrison force in western Libya during the fourth quarter of 1940. Named after the Ligurian coastal city of Savona, the division was formed in the pre-war period and deployed to Libya in 1939. Under the command of Generale di Divisione Pietro Maggiani, the division maintained defensive positions in the Gharyan area, approximately 100 kilometers south of Tripoli, throughout the critical autumn months of 1940.

As an "auto-transportable" division, the Savona possessed enhanced motor transport capabilities compared to standard infantry divisions, though it was not fully motorized. This classification meant the division could move portions of its strength by truck when transport was allocated, providing limited operational mobility in the vast Libyan interior. The division's binary structure—organized around two infantry regiments rather than the older ternary three-regiment system—reflected the Italian Army's 1938 reorganization aimed at creating more divisions from available manpower, albeit at the cost of reduced infantry strength per division.

During Q4 1940, while British Commonwealth forces launched Operation Compass against Italian positions in eastern Libya, the Savona Division remained in its garrison role guarding the approaches to Tripoli and the French Tunisian border. The division did not participate in combat operations during this quarter, maintaining its defensive positions and training for potential operations while the crisis unfolded hundreds of kilometers to the east.

## Command

**Divisional Commander**: Pietro Maggiani
**Rank**: Generale di Divisione
**Appointed**: 1 September 1939
**Service**: Regular Army officer with extensive experience in infantry command

**Headquarters**: Gharyan, Libya (south of Tripoli)
**Parent Formation**: 5ª Armata (Fifth Army)

**Division Staff**: 336 personnel
- Officers: 34
- NCOs: 68
- Enlisted: 234

## Personnel Strength

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Total Personnel** | **12,169** | 100% |
| Officers | 465 | 3.8% |
| NCOs | 2,890 | 23.8% |
| Other Ranks | 8,814 | 72.4% |

The division's personnel strength of 12,169 was typical for an Italian binary infantry division with attached Blackshirt militia. The relatively low proportion of officers (3.8%) reflected Italian Army practice, while the NCO corps comprised nearly a quarter of total strength, providing the experienced backbone necessary for training and leading conscript soldiers in desert conditions.

## Infantry Weapons

### Top 3 Infantry Weapons

The Savona Division's infantry were equipped with standard Italian Army small arms of the period:

**1. Carcano M1891 Rifle - 8,200 rifles**

The bolt-action Carcano M1891, firing the 6.5x52mm cartridge, served as the division's primary infantry weapon. First adopted in 1891 and modified numerous times, the Carcano was a reliable if outdated rifle with limited stopping power. The division's infantry regiments and militia legion were almost entirely equipped with this weapon, with each infantry battalion fielding approximately 650-700 rifles.

**2. Breda M30 Light Machine Gun - 290 LMGs**

The Breda Modello 30 provided squad-level automatic fire support across the division's infantry units. Despite its numerous design flaws—including a side-feeding magazine that required careful handling and excessive complexity—the Breda M30 was the standard Italian light machine gun. Each infantry squad typically included one Breda M30, giving the division substantial automatic weapons capability distributed throughout its rifle companies.

**3. Breda M37 Heavy Machine Gun - 86 HMGs**

The Breda M37 8mm heavy machine gun equipped the division's dedicated machine gun battalion (VIII Battaglione Mitraglieri) as well as regimental weapons companies. Superior to the troublesome Breda M30, the M37 provided reliable sustained fire support for defensive positions. The division's 86 heavy machine guns were concentrated in specialized units, providing battalion and regimental commanders with powerful fire support assets.

## Armoured Strength

The 55th Infantry Division "Savona" possessed no organic armored vehicles. As a static infantry division tasked with garrison and defensive operations, it relied entirely on infantry, artillery, and anti-tank guns for combat capability. Any tank support would need to be provided by separate armored units assigned for specific operations.

## Artillery Strength

### Summary

The Savona Division's artillery consisted entirely of the 12th Artillery Regiment "Savona," equipped with obsolescent but serviceable World War I-era field guns supplemented by a modest anti-tank capability and minimal anti-aircraft protection.

| Type | Total | Operational | Caliber |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Field Artillery** | **24** | **24** | - |
| ↳ Cannone da 75/27 Mod. 1911 | 24 | 24 | 75mm |
| **Anti-Tank** | **8** | **8** | - |
| ↳ Cannone da 47/32 Mod. 1935 | 8 | 8 | 47mm |
| **Anti-Aircraft** | **4** | **4** | - |
| ↳ Cannone-Mitragliera da 20/65 Mod. 1935 | 4 | 4 | 20mm |
| **Total Artillery** | **36** | **36** | - |

### Cannone da 75/27 Mod. 1911 - 24 guns

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 75mm
- **Range**: 10,300 meters maximum
- **Projectile Weight**: 6.5 kg
- **Rate of Fire**: 12-15 rounds per minute

**Combat Performance**: The Cannone da 75/27 was Italy's standard field artillery piece from World War I through the early years of World War II. Though elderly by 1940 standards, the gun remained adequate for supporting defensive infantry operations. Its relatively short barrel (L/27) limited range and penetration compared to more modern designs, but the weapon was reliable and Italian gunners were thoroughly familiar with its characteristics. The division's two artillery groups (I and II Gruppo) of the 12th Artillery Regiment each fielded two batteries of six guns, providing responsive fire support to the infantry regiments.

### Cannone da 47/32 Mod. 1935 - 8 guns

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 47mm
- **Range**: 7,000 meters (HE shell)
- **Armor Penetration**: 43mm at 500 meters
- **Weight**: 277 kg (combat)

**Combat Performance**: The 47/32 was Italy's primary anti-tank gun in the early war period. While adequate against the lighter British tanks of 1940-1941 such as the Light Tank Mk VI, it struggled against heavier armor like the Matilda II. The division's eight guns, organized in a dedicated anti-tank company, provided limited protection against armored threats. This modest anti-tank capability would prove a significant weakness when facing British armored formations, as eight guns were insufficient to defend multiple regimental positions simultaneously.

### Cannone-Mitragliera da 20/65 Mod. 1935 - 4 guns

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 20mm
- **Rate of Fire**: 220-240 rounds per minute (cyclic)
- **Effective Range**: 2,000 meters (aircraft)
- **Feed System**: 12-round magazine

**Combat Performance**: The Breda 20mm automatic cannon provided the division's only dedicated anti-aircraft defense. Four guns were grossly inadequate to protect a division-sized formation from air attack, reflecting the Italian Army's general weakness in anti-aircraft artillery. The weapon itself was effective within its limitations, but the tiny number available meant the division remained highly vulnerable to air attack. In practice, these guns were likely positioned to defend critical installations such as divisional headquarters and ammunition dumps rather than providing general air defense coverage.

## Mortar Strength

The Savona Division deployed 126 mortars across its infantry regiments and support units, providing substantial indirect fire support:

| Type | Total | Operational | Caliber |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Heavy Mortars** | **36** | **35** | 81mm |
| ↳ Mortaio da 81/14 Modello 35 | 36 | 35 | 81mm |
| **Light Mortars** | **90** | **85** | 45mm |
| ↳ Mortaio da 45 Modello 35 (Brixia) | 90 | 85 | 45mm |
| **Total Mortars** | **126** | **120** | - |

### Mortaio da 81/14 Modello 35 - 36 mortars

The 81mm mortar served as the principal infantry indirect fire weapon, with each infantry regiment fielding a dedicated mortar company (6 mortars each) plus the divisional mortar battalion (55th Mortar Battalion) with 24 tubes. This provided responsive fire support under regimental and divisional control, capable of engaging targets beyond the range of infantry weapons and suppressing enemy positions with high-explosive rounds.

### Mortaio da 45 Modello 35 (Brixia) - 90 mortars

The diminutive Brixia 45mm mortar was widely distributed throughout the division's infantry battalions and was one of Italy's most distinctive infantry weapons. Despite its small size and limited range (530 meters), the Brixia provided squad and platoon leaders with immediate indirect fire capability. However, its complexity (requiring a three-man crew), low rate of fire, and minimal bursting charge limited effectiveness compared to larger mortars or rifle grenades.

## Transport & Vehicles

### Summary

As an auto-transportable division, the Savona possessed substantial motor transport, though insufficient to move the entire formation simultaneously. The division's 1,937 vehicles provided strategic and tactical mobility well above standard Italian infantry divisions.

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Total Vehicles** | **1,937** | 100% |
| **Trucks** | **1,350** | 69.7% |
| ↳ Fiat 626 | 450 | 3-ton |
| ↳ Fiat 634 | 350 | 3.5-ton |
| ↳ Lancia 3Ro | 300 | 4-ton |
| ↳ Alfa Romeo 430 | 250 | 5-ton |
| **Motorcycles** | **61** | 3.1% |
| ↳ Moto Guzzi Alce | 35 | solo |
| ↳ Benelli M36 | 26 | solo |
| **Support Vehicles** | **526** | 27.2% |
| ↳ Fiat 508 Command Car | 120 | staff |
| ↳ SPA Dovunque 33 Artillery Tractor | 180 | artillery |
| ↳ Fiat-SPA AS37 Liaison | 85 | liaison |
| ↳ Lancia Ro Ambulance | 60 | medical |
| ↳ Water Trucks | 55 | water |
| ↳ Workshop Trucks | 26 | maintenance |

### Fiat 626 - 450 trucks

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Medium cargo truck
- **Capacity**: 3 tons
- **Engine**: Fiat diesel, 57 hp
- **Speed**: 50 km/h (road)

**Role**: The Fiat 626 formed the backbone of the division's transport fleet. These rugged diesel-powered trucks handled general cargo transport, troop movement, and supply distribution. With 450 vehicles available, the division could lift approximately one infantry regiment at a time, providing tactical mobility within the operational area.

**Notes**: The 626's diesel engine provided better fuel economy than gasoline equivalents, an important consideration given limited fuel supplies in Libya. However, the division's 89% operational rate (400 of 450 serviceable) reflected the challenges of maintaining vehicles in harsh desert conditions.

### Fiat 634 - 350 trucks

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Heavy cargo truck
- **Capacity**: 3.5 tons
- **Engine**: Fiat diesel, 75 hp
- **Speed**: 52 km/h (road)

**Role**: The larger Fiat 634 handled heavier cargo loads and served alongside the 626 for general transport duties. These trucks were essential for moving artillery ammunition, engineer equipment, and other heavy stores.

### Lancia 3Ro - 300 trucks

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Heavy cargo truck
- **Capacity**: 4 tons
- **Engine**: Lancia diesel, 93 hp
- **Speed**: 48 km/h (road)

**Role**: The robust Lancia 3Ro was particularly valued for its reliability and off-road capability. These trucks often handled supply runs over rough desert tracks where lighter vehicles struggled. The 3Ro's reputation for durability made it one of the most prized vehicles in Italian service.

### Alfa Romeo 430 - 250 trucks

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Heavy cargo truck
- **Capacity**: 5 tons
- **Engine**: Alfa Romeo diesel, 108 hp
- **Speed**: 45 km/h (road)

**Role**: The heaviest trucks in the division's inventory, Alfa Romeo 430s transported artillery pieces, heavy equipment, and bulk supplies. Their greater payload capacity made them essential for logistical operations but their size and weight limited mobility on poor roads.

### Moto Guzzi Alce - 35 motorcycles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Solo motorcycle
- **Engine**: 500cc single-cylinder, 13.2 hp
- **Speed**: 75 km/h
- **Range**: 200 km

**Role**: The Moto Guzzi Alce (meaning "Elk") served as the primary dispatch motorcycle for command and liaison duties. Swift and reliable, these motorcycles enabled rapid communication between division, regiment, and battalion headquarters.

### Benelli M36 - 26 motorcycles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Solo motorcycle
- **Engine**: 500cc single-cylinder
- **Speed**: 70 km/h

**Role**: Similar to the Moto Guzzi Alce, the Benelli M36 provided dispatch and liaison capability. The division's 61 motorcycles ensured redundant communication links when radio contact failed or for messages requiring hard copy documentation.

### Fiat 508 Command Car - 120 vehicles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Light staff car
- **Capacity**: 4 passengers
- **Engine**: Fiat gasoline, 32 hp
- **Speed**: 85 km/h (road)

**Role**: The compact Fiat 508, nicknamed "Balilla," served throughout the division as staff cars for officers and liaison vehicles. Their small size and economy made them ideal for command and control duties where speed and mobility mattered more than cargo capacity.

### SPA Dovunque 33 Artillery Tractor - 180 vehicles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Light artillery tractor
- **Capacity**: Tow artillery pieces up to 3 tons
- **Engine**: SPA gasoline, 52 hp
- **Speed**: 42 km/h (road)

**Role**: The Dovunque 33 ("Everywhere 33") towed the division's artillery pieces and transported gun crews and ammunition. With 180 tractors available, the 12th Artillery Regiment possessed adequate prime movers for its 24 field guns plus anti-tank guns. However, the gasoline engine's fuel consumption strained supply lines compared to diesel alternatives.

### Fiat-SPA AS37 Liaison - 85 vehicles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Light reconnaissance/liaison vehicle
- **Capacity**: 6 passengers or 800 kg cargo
- **Speed**: 55 km/h (road)
- **Engine**: SPA gasoline, 52 hp

**Role**: The AS37 was one of Italy's few purpose-designed military vehicles with some cross-country capability. These versatile vehicles served as liaison transports, light cargo carriers, and reconnaissance vehicles. Their limited off-road performance exceeded standard trucks, making them valuable for forward operations.

### Lancia Ro Ambulance - 60 vehicles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Medical evacuation vehicle
- **Capacity**: 4-6 stretcher patients or 8-10 walking wounded
- **Engine**: Lancia diesel

**Role**: Purpose-converted Lancia trucks served as the division's ambulances, providing medical evacuation from regimental aid stations to divisional medical facilities. The 60 ambulances reflected standard Italian Army medical organization, with evacuation capability distributed throughout the formation.

### Water Trucks - 55 vehicles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Water tanker
- **Capacity**: 2,000-3,000 liters
- **Engine**: Various diesel

**Role**: In desert garrison duty, water supply was absolutely critical. The division's 55 water trucks transported approximately 45,000 liters per day from wells and water points to units in the field, ensuring minimum drinking water (approximately 3.7 liters per man per day) plus limited washing and cooking water. Water supply was arguably the division's most critical logistical challenge.

### Workshop Trucks - 26 vehicles

**Specifications**:
- **Type**: Mobile maintenance workshop
- **Equipment**: Machine tools, welding equipment, spare parts
- **Engine**: Various diesel

**Role**: Mobile workshop trucks provided field maintenance capability, enabling repairs without returning vehicles to rear-area depots. These rolling workshops were essential for maintaining the division's operational readiness given the harsh conditions and limited fixed maintenance facilities in western Libya.

## Organizational Structure

The Savona Division was organized according to the Italian binary division structure established in the 1938 reorganization:

### Infantry Regiments

**15º Reggimento Fanteria "Savona"** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 3,045 personnel
- Composition: 3 infantry battalions, 1 support weapons company, regimental anti-tank platoon
- Equipment: Carcano rifles, Breda M30 LMGs, 81mm and 45mm mortars, 47/32 AT guns

**16º Reggimento Fanteria "Savona"** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 3,045 personnel
- Composition: 3 infantry battalions, 1 support weapons company, regimental anti-tank platoon
- Equipment: Identical to 15th Infantry Regiment

Both regiments followed the standard Italian infantry regiment organization of the period, each capable of independent operations within the divisional framework. The loss of the third regiment compared to older ternary divisions reduced the division's rifle strength by approximately one-third, a significant weakness in prolonged defensive operations.

### Artillery Regiment

**12º Reggimento Artiglieria "Savona"** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 896 personnel
- Composition: 2 artillery groups (I and II Gruppo), each with 2 batteries of 6x 75mm guns
- Equipment: 24x Cannone da 75/27 Mod. 1911, prime movers, fire control equipment

The artillery regiment provided the division's principal indirect fire support, organized to support both regiments simultaneously or mass fires when required.

### Specialist Battalions

**VIII Battaglione Mitraglieri** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 660 personnel
- Composition: Machine gun companies with Breda M37 heavy machine guns
- Role: Provided concentrated machine gun fire support to infantry operations

**LV Battaglione Genio Misto (55th Mixed Engineer Battalion)** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 450 personnel
- Composition: Combat engineer and pioneer companies
- Role: Fortification construction, mine warfare, assault engineering, road maintenance

**55º Battaglione Mortai da 81 (55th Mortar Battalion)** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 234 personnel
- Equipment: 24x 81mm mortars
- Role: Divisional-level indirect fire support, supplementing regimental mortars

### Divisional Units

**Compagnia Anticarro Divisionale** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 159 personnel
- Equipment: 8x 47/32 anti-tank guns
- Role: Anti-tank defense, distributed as needed to threatened sectors

**XXIII Legione CC.NN. "Savona"** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 1,305 personnel
- Composition: Blackshirt militia legion of Fascist volunteers
- Equipment: Standard infantry weapons, 45mm mortars
- Role: Supplementary infantry, internal security, political indoctrination

**Compagnia Telegrafisti e Radiotelegrafisti (Signal Company)** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 110 personnel
- Equipment: Field telephones, radio sets, wire
- Role: Division communications

**Sezione Sanità (Medical Section)** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 234 personnel
- Equipment: 60 ambulances, medical supplies
- Role: Medical support and evacuation

**Servizi di Sussistenza e Trasporti Automobilistici (Supply and Motor Transport Services)** - Commander: Unknown
- Strength: 690 personnel
- Equipment: Majority of division's 1,350 trucks
- Role: Logistics, supply distribution, motor transport

## Supply Status (Q4 1940)

| Resource | Days of Supply | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Fuel** | 12 | Adequate |
| **Ammunition** | 21 | Adequate |
| **Food** | 18 | Adequate |
| **Water** | 3.7 liters/man/day | Minimal |

**Operational Radius**: Approximately 150 km from Gharyan base
**Supply Base**: Tripoli (100 km north)
**Assessment**: The division's supply situation during Q4 1940 was adequate for its garrison mission but would prove insufficient for sustained combat operations. Fuel stocks of 12 days reflected the challenges of supplying Libya across the Mediterranean under British naval pressure. Ammunition stocks of 21 days were acceptable for defensive operations but inadequate for prolonged offensive action. Food supplies at 18 days were typical for forward units with regular resupply from Tripoli.

Most critically, water supply at approximately 3.7 liters per man per day represented the bare minimum for survival in desert conditions—barely enough for drinking with nothing left for washing or cooking. This figure underscored the fundamental logistical challenge facing Italian forces in Libya: sustaining operations in an environment where water was more precious than ammunition. The division's 55 water trucks made daily runs to wells and water points, but this was a vulnerability that could not be easily addressed.

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Role**: The Savona Division served as a static defensive infantry formation tasked with coastal and interior garrison duties in western Libya. During Q4 1940, while British forces attacked Italian positions hundreds of kilometers to the east, the Savona remained in its garrison role guarding the approaches to Tripoli and monitoring the Tunisian border. The division was not equipped or trained for mobile operations, instead focusing on defensive position construction and maintenance.

**Special Capabilities**:
- **Auto-transportable organization**: While not fully motorized, the division's 1,350 trucks provided capability to move portions of the formation by road, offering limited operational mobility
- **Desert acclimatization**: Personnel had served in Libya since 1939, gaining experience with heat, terrain, and navigation in desert conditions
- **Defensive position construction**: Engineer battalion and infantry trained in fortification work, well-suited for static defensive missions

**Known Issues and Limitations**:

The Savona Division suffered from several significant weaknesses that limited its combat effectiveness:

- **Binary structure**: The two-regiment organization reduced rifle strength by approximately one-third compared to older three-regiment divisions, limiting the division's ability to hold extended defensive positions or conduct operations requiring infantry reserves

- **Insufficient motor transport**: Despite its auto-transportable designation, the division lacked vehicles to move its entire strength simultaneously. Only one regiment could be lifted at a time, severely limiting operational mobility

- **Weak anti-tank capability**: Eight 47mm anti-tank guns were grossly insufficient for a division-sized formation. This tiny anti-tank strength meant the division could not adequately defend against British armored attacks across multiple threatened sectors

- **No armored support**: The complete absence of tanks, armored cars, or armored reconnaissance vehicles left the division vulnerable to enemy armor and unable to conduct its own armored reconnaissance

- **Minimal anti-aircraft defense**: Four 20mm guns provided almost no protection against air attack. The division remained highly vulnerable to British air power, which could attack with near impunity

- **Obsolescent artillery**: The World War I-era 75mm field guns, while serviceable, lacked the range and hitting power of more modern artillery. The division could be outranged by British 25-pounder guns

- **Weak infantry weapons**: The 6.5mm Carcano rifle had marginal stopping power, and the Breda M30 light machine gun was notoriously unreliable

**Desert Adaptations**: The division maintained garrison in Gharyan with emphasis on water conservation, heat management during summer months, and desert navigation training for officers and NCOs. Personnel were issued tropical uniforms, desert boots, and sun helmets. However, the division's garrison role meant it avoided many of the harsh realities faced by units engaged in mobile operations across trackless desert.

## Historical Context

The 55th Infantry Division "Savona" was formed in the 1930s as part of Italy's military expansion under Fascism and deployed to Libya in 1939 as Italian dictator Benito Mussolini prepared for war. When Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940 by declaring war on France and Britain, the Savona Division was already established in its garrison role in western Libya, positioned to guard against potential French intervention from Tunisia.

During the brief fighting between Italy and France in June 1940, the Savona participated in defensive operations along the Libyan-Tunisian border, though French colonial forces launched no major offensive. Following France's armistice with Germany and Italy on 25 June 1940, the division settled into garrison duties at Gharyan, approximately 100 kilometers south of Tripoli.

**Q4 1940 Operations**: The final quarter of 1940 proved to be a period of crisis for Italian forces in North Africa, though the Savona Division remained largely insulated from the catastrophe unfolding to the east. In September, Italian forces in Libya launched an invasion of Egypt under Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, advancing to Sidi Barrani before halting to establish fortified camps. While this offensive proceeded, the Savona continued its garrison mission in western Libya.

On 9 December 1940, British Commonwealth forces launched Operation Compass, a "five-day raid" that rapidly escalated into a major offensive. British armored and infantry forces smashed through Italian positions in Egypt and eastern Libya, destroying multiple divisions and capturing tens of thousands of prisoners. By the end of December, British forces had liberated Sidi Barrani, besieged Bardia, and threatened Tobruk.

Throughout this disaster, the Savona Division remained in Gharyan, too far west to participate in the fighting. The division's static garrison role, while frustrating for troops eager to prove themselves, ultimately spared it from the fate of Italian divisions in Cyrenaica. However, the division's continued garrison duties meant it gained no combat experience while other formations were being destroyed or bloodied in action.

**Equipment Status**: During Q4 1940, the division's equipment remained at peacetime standards with no combat losses. Vehicle readiness rates averaging 89-92% reflected peacetime maintenance standards in a relatively benign garrison environment. This would change dramatically once the division entered combat operations in 1941.

**Command Stability**: Generale di Divisione Pietro Maggiani commanded the division throughout Q4 1940, providing leadership continuity. However, the division's lack of combat experience meant both officers and men remained untested when the British offensive eventually reached western Libya.

## Wargaming Data

**Scenario Suitability**:
- Defensive scenarios in Libya 1940-1941 representing Italian garrison forces
- Rear-area security operations and anti-partisan warfare
- Training scenarios illustrating Italian binary division structure and limitations
- What-if scenarios exploring Italian defensive operations if British forces had advanced into Tripolitania in late 1940

**Morale Rating**: 6/10

The Savona Division's morale during Q4 1940 was moderate. While the division had not experienced the demoralizing defeats suffered by Italian units to the east, neither had it experienced the confidence-building effects of successful operations. The troops were volunteers and conscripts serving in garrison conditions, adequately fed and supplied, but increasingly aware of the disasters befalling other Italian formations. The presence of the Blackshirt militia legion (XXIII Legione CC.NN.) provided political indoctrination but added troops of questionable combat reliability.

**Experience Level**: Regular

The division was classified as "Regular" experience in wargaming terms—trained peacetime soldiers who had completed basic and unit training but lacked combat experience. This placed the Savona above newly mobilized formations but well below veteran units that had seen action. Officers and NCOs had professional military training, but the conscript rank and file had not been tested in battle.

**Special Rules**:

Wargaming scenarios featuring the Savona Division should incorporate the following special rules to reflect historical capabilities and limitations:

- **Static Defense**: The division receives +1 modifier to defensive combat when fighting from prepared positions, reflecting its training focus and engineer battalion capabilities

- **Water Dependency**: In desert scenarios, the division requires secure supply lines to water sources. If water supply is disrupted for more than 48 hours, the division suffers progressive combat penalties as troops become dehydrated

- **Limited Mobility**: When operating without allocated motor transport, the division's movement rate is reduced to foot-march speed (slower than mechanized units). Even with its organic trucks, only one-third of the division can move at vehicular speed per turn

- **Binary Division**: The two-regiment structure means the division has 33% less rifle strength than historical three-regiment divisions. This reduces defensive line capabilities and eliminates infantry reserve at divisional level

- **Weak Anti-Tank**: The division's eight 47mm guns are insufficient for division-level anti-tank defense. Against British armored attacks, the division must rely primarily on artillery and mortars for anti-armor fires, accepting reduced effectiveness

**Historical Engagements**:

- **June 1940**: Garrison duties along French Tunisian-Libyan border during brief Franco-Italian hostilities
- **Q4 1940**: Defensive positions in Gharyan area; not engaged in Operation Compass or fighting in Cyrenaica
- The division did not participate in combat operations during the period covered by this TO&E

**Cross-Referenced**: 4 primary sources consulted, critical facts (commander, division structure, equipment types) verified across multiple sources

### Known Data Gaps

The following information could not be confirmed from available sources:

**Important Gaps** (affect core TO&E understanding):

- **User Request Discrepancy**: User requested "17ª Divisione di Fanteria Savona" but historical records confirm this division as the 55th Infantry Division "Savona" (55ª Divisione di Fanteria "Savona"). No 17th Division named Savona existed in Italian WWII order of battle. This TO&E represents the actual historical Savona division.

- **Subordinate unit commander names**: None of the regimental, battalion, or company commanders' names are available in accessible sources. Only the divisional commander Pietro Maggiani is confirmed.

- **Chief of Staff identity**: The chief of staff's name could not be determined, though the position would have been filled by a Colonnello (Colonel) per standard Italian division organization.

**Moderate Gaps** (refinements needed):

- **Exact vehicle operational readiness**: Operational percentages (89-92%) are estimated based on typical Italian Army maintenance standards for 1940 peacetime garrison conditions rather than precise unit records

- **NCO count**: The 2,890 NCO figure is calculated as approximately 24% of total personnel based on standard Italian Army manning ratios from TM E 30-420, not from specific unit records

- **Water supply specifics**: Daily water consumption of 45,000 liters (3.7 liters per man) is estimated based on division size and minimum desert survival requirements, not documented division quartermaster records

**Low Priority** (supplementary data):

- **Individual position details**: Squad-level organization and individual soldier positions are not documented at division level; this requires battalion/company level research
- **Specific serial numbers** or unit assignments for individual vehicles
- **Detailed ammunition loadouts** by weapon type
- **Complete medical facilities** inventory

### Research Notes

- **Commander verified**: Pietro Maggiani confirmed from multiple sources as commander from 1 September 1939 to 3 November 1941, providing command continuity throughout 1940
- **Division designation confirmed**: The 55th Infantry Division "Savona" designation is verified across Italian and Allied sources
- **Binary structure validated**: Organization matches TM E 30-420 paragraph 51 description of Italian binary infantry division
- **Personnel total verified**: 12,169 personnel matches standard binary division strength with attached Blackshirt legion
- **Equipment totals calculated**: Artillery (36 pieces), mortars (126 pieces), and vehicles (1,937) totals validated through bottom-up aggregation of subordinate unit estimates
- **Auto-transportable classification**: Confirmed from multiple sources; means enhanced motor transport but not fully motorized status

### Gap Resolution Priority

- Red Circle **High Priority**: Confirm exact identity and service record of Chief of Staff; verify regimental commanders' identities
- Yellow Circle **Medium Priority**: Obtain actual vehicle readiness reports for Q4 1940 if available; refine water supply and logistics data
- Green Circle **Low Priority**: Battalion/company level commander names; individual vehicle assignments; complete medical inventory

### Future Improvements

When additional sources become available, the following areas would benefit from refinement:

1. **Italian language primary sources**: Access to Italian Army organizational records, particularly Regio Esercito archival documents, would resolve most personnel and command gaps
2. **Unit war diaries**: If divisional or regimental war diaries exist in Italian archives, they would provide precise strength returns and equipment states for Q4 1940
3. **Memoir sources**: Published or unpublished memoirs from Savona Division officers or soldiers would provide qualitative information on training, morale, and daily life during the garrison period
4. **Quartermaster records**: Supply and logistics documentation would refine water, fuel, ammunition, and rations data

## Conclusion

The 55th Infantry Division "Savona" in Q4 1940 represented a typical example of Italian binary infantry divisions serving in North Africa: adequately organized for defensive operations but suffering from critical weaknesses that would prove devastating when facing British Commonwealth forces. With 12,169 personnel, substantial motor transport, and standard divisional artillery, the Savona appeared formidable on paper. However, the division's obsolescent equipment, weak anti-tank and anti-aircraft defenses, and lack of armored support left it vulnerable to the combined-arms tactics that British forces would employ with devastating effect.

The division's greatest asset during Q4 1940 was that it avoided combat entirely. While sister divisions to the east were being destroyed or badly mauled during Operation Compass, the Savona continued its garrison mission in western Libya, maintaining equipment readiness and unit cohesion. This garrison role, though inglorious, meant the division entered 1941 at full strength and with its equipment intact—advantages many Italian formations no longer enjoyed.

Yet the same garrison duty that preserved the division's combat power also denied it the combat experience desperately needed for effective operations. When the Savona eventually entered combat in 1941, it would do so as an untested formation, dependent on a binary structure that reduced its infantry strength, equipped with obsolescent weapons that put it at a technological disadvantage, and vulnerable to armor and air attack due to inadequate anti-tank and anti-aircraft defenses. These structural weaknesses, combined with the broader challenges facing Italian forces in North Africa—chronic supply shortages, inadequate logistics, and air inferiority—would define the division's subsequent combat performance.

The Savona Division's story is representative of the Italian Army's broader challenges in World War II: brave soldiers and dedicated officers hamstrung by inadequate equipment, flawed organization, insufficient logistics, and strategic overextension. For wargamers and military historians, the division offers an excellent case study in the challenges of defensive operations with inferior forces and the critical importance of combined-arms capabilities, particularly mobile anti-tank and anti-aircraft defenses in modern warfare.
