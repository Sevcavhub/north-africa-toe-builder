The division fought in the Gazala offensive and subsequent operations through 1942.",

The 12th Bersaglieri Regiment from Milan provided effective motorized infantry support. The LANCIERI DI NOVARA reconnaissance group brought cavalry traditions to armored warfare. Tank strength typically 75-80% operational due to mechanical issues and growing battle damage.",

Chronic shortages of recovery vehicles and spare parts affected operational readiness. Fuel and water supply were perpetual problems in desert operations.",

Ammunition and supply stocks adequate for early summer operations. Water tanker allocation increased for desert summer conditions. Overall operational readiness approximately 77% by June 1942.",
    "future_fate": "The 133rd LITTORIO Armored Division was destroyed in North Africa in December 1942 during the final stages of the El Alamein campaign and subsequent retreat. Unlike the 132nd ARIETE which was annihilated at El Alamein itself, LITTORIO survived the main battle but was destroyed in the fighting withdrawal through Libya. The division was not reconstituted.",

The sources clearly identify the 133rd LITTORIO Armored Division (home station Parma) and the separate 132nd ARIETE Armored Division (home station Verona).
