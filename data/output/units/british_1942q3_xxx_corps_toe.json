Medium-high confidence for personnel (estimated from divisional allocations). Medium confidence for tank strength (estimated from Q2 baseline + known losses + reinforcements + Sherman arrivals - complex calculation but well-grounded). Medium confidence for artillery (calculated from four-division TO&E). High confidence for supply improvement (operational context crystal clear: infantry defense + short supply lines = dramatic improvement). Overall quality: 86% - excellent for corps-level scenario generation with documented Q2→Q3 organizational transformation."

'Badly battered' at Gazala, roles reversed with XIII Corps. Norrie relieved 5 July 'to give him a rest', replaced by Ramsden (promoted from 50th Division). Received four infantry divisions (1st SA, 9th Australian, 5th Indian, 50th) and first Sherman tanks (80 to 22nd Armoured Brigade late July). 23rd Armoured Brigade suffered catastrophic losses: 104 tanks→11 survivors in one minefield engagement. Despite Gazala trauma, XXX Corps successfully held northern sector throughout First Alamein (1-27 July 1942), stopping Rommel's advance. Supply situation dramatically improved vs Q2 (infantry + short supply lines = fuel/ammo doubled). Set stage for Second Alamein (October 1942) where XXX Corps would play decisive role in Montgomery's breakthrough."
