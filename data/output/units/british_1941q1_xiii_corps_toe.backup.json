Australian casualties: 130 KIA, 326 WIA.\n- Battle of Tobruk (21-22 January): 6th Australian Division captured fortress in 36 hours. 25,000 POWs, 462 guns, 236 vehicles captured. Australian casualties: 49 KIA, 306 WIA.\n\n**February Operations:**\n- Pursuit to Benghazi: 7th Armoured Division and 6th Australian Division advanced 150 miles in 10 days. Benghazi occupied 6 February.\n- Battle of Beda Fomm (5-7 February): 7th Armoured Division destroyed remnants of Italian 10th Army. Final victory of Operation Compass.\n\n**March:**\n- 6th Australian Division withdrawn to Palestine for rest/refit (later deployed Greece).\n- Corps reduced in strength but maintained positions in Cyrenaica.\n- German Afrika Korps arrival (March 1941) fundamentally changed situation.\n\nMorale excellent throughout Q1. Three major fortress assaults and pursuit operations executed with overwhelming success. Corps captured 130,000+ Italian POWs, destroyed Italian 10th Army completely. Vehicle readiness declined from 95% to 88% during quarter due to continuous operations and desert wear. Overall combat effectiveness remained very high despite logistical strain."

    "historical_context": "XIII Corps during Q1 1941 was the continuation of Western Desert Force's spectacular Operation Compass offensive. Renamed on 1 January 1941, the corps conducted three major operations: Battle of Bardia (3-5 Jan) where 6th Australian Division with 7th RTR Matilda support captured 45,000 POWs; Battle of Tobruk (21-22 Jan) where 6th Australian Division captured another 25,000 POWs; and Battle of Beda Fomm (5-7 Feb) where 7th Armoured Division destroyed remnants of Italian 10th Army. In two months, XIII Corps advanced 800 kilometers, destroyed Italian 10th Army, captured 130,000+ POWs, 400+ tanks, and 1,290 guns while suffering only 500 KIA and 1,373 WIA total. This was one of the most stunning military victories in history. However, 6th Australian Division withdrew to Palestine in March for Greece deployment, reducing corps strength. German Afrika Korps arrival (March 1941) ended British period of superiority. Quarter ends with XIII Corps holding Cyrenaica but facing new, far more dangerous opponent."
