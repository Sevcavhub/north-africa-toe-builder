High confidence for organizational shift (infantry corps → infantry+armor corps) based on 'escaped Gazala in better condition' quote. Medium-high confidence for personnel (estimated from divisional allocations). Medium confidence for tank strength (estimated from Q2 baseline + 7th Armoured Division addition - Tobruk/Gazala losses). Medium confidence for artillery (calculated from divisional TO&E). Overall quality: 84% - excellent for corps-level scenario generation with documented Q2→Q3 organizational transformation."

Gott killed 7 August 1942 en route to assume 8th Army command - one of war's great 'what ifs' (would 8th Army have been different under Gott vs Montgomery?). Qattara Depression position prevented southern outflanking, allowing XIII Corps to conduct mobile defense without flank security concerns."
