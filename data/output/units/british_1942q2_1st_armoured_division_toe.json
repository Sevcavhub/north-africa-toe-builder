  "combat_history_summary": "British 1st Armoured Division fought in the disastrous Battle of Gazala (May 26 - June 21, 1942), the largest tank battle in North Africa to that date. Despite receiving new M3 Grant tanks with 75mm guns and 6-pounder anti-tank guns for the first time, the division was defeated due to poor tactical coordination and the flawed Brigade Group organization that prevented concentration of force. Rommel's flanking maneuver around the southern end of the Gazala Line led to fierce tank battles in the 'Cauldron' area where British armoured brigades were defeated piecemeal. The division lost over 200 tanks and was forced to withdraw to the Egyptian frontier, contributing to the fall of Tobruk on June 21, 1942. The battle demonstrated that superior equipment alone could not compensate for poor doctrine and tactical fragmentation."
