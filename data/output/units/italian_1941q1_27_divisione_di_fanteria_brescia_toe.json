Equipment maintained at higher operational percentages than combat-worn units. Morale good but sobered by news of defeats at Beda Fomm and Bardia. Division studied lessons from British offensive: armor superiority, speed of British advances, inadequacy of Italian anti-tank weapons. Training emphasized anti-tank defense, night operations, and defensive tactics. Autotrasportabile (semi-motorized) classification maintained operational mobility for potential deployment. Division positioned as reserve for German-Italian counteroffensive expected in spring 1941."
