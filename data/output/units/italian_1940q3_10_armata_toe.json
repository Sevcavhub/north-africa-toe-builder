(4) Static defensive doctrine in isolated camps vulnerable to defeat in detail. (5) Poor coordination between divisions/corps - no mobile reserve.

Equipment/personnel completeness LOW (67%) due to partial extraction. CRITICAL CORRECTION: Previous project file incorrectly identified Graziani as 10th Army commander during Q3 1940. Nafziger 940ilab.pdf confirms Gariboldi commanded 'until 11/17/40' and Berti commanded 'until 12/23/40', establishing Berti as Q3 commander. Graziani was Commandante Superiore (theater/Governor), not army commander."
