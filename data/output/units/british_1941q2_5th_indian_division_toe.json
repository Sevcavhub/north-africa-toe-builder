    "notes": "5th Indian Division data for Q2 1941 focuses on East Africa Campaign (Eritrea/Abyssinia). Primary sources document Amba Alagi campaign (April-May) and transition to Egypt (June). Division well-documented for 1942 North Africa campaigns (Gazala, El Alamein) but Q2 1941 East Africa period has less detailed equipment data. Brigade compositions confirmed from multiple sources. Personnel strength estimated from standard Indian division establishment (~15,000-16,000). Equipment totals based on divisional TO&E and East Africa supply constraints."
