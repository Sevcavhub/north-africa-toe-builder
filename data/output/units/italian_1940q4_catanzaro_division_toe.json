Transport crisis extensively documented in Playfair and Macksey: operational rate declined Q3→Q4 (37%→33%). Division operational history: static defense Buqbuq sector (Oct-9 Dec), British penetration Operation Compass (9-10 Dec), retreat to Bardia (13-15 Dec), destroyed Battle of Bardia (5 Jan 1941). Autotrasportabile division standard strength (~10,500 men) per Paoletti.
