      "personnel_strength": "Estimated 13,800 based on Q4 1941 strength (~14,500) minus approximately 5% additional casualties/evacuations during final Tobruk period. Australian War Memorial records confirm division was 'understrength' in Q1 1942 but exact numbers not published.",
      "equipment_losses": "Vehicle and carrier numbers reduced 10-15% from Q4 1941 baseline reflecting siege wear/losses. Australian sources confirm 'significant equipment shortages' requiring replacement in Syria but exact loss figures not available in accessible sources.",
      "commander_changes": "Most subordinate unit commanders retained from Q4 1941 (continuity typical during reconstitution). Changes may have occurred but not documented in available online sources - would require Australian Army archives access.",
      "24th_brigade_strength": "2/32nd Battalion status uncertain - unit was evacuated from Tobruk earlier in siege, reconstituting in Q1 1942 but exact strength unknown. Estimated 880 men (normal battalion strength) but likely lower."

    "methodology": "Data compiled from Q4 1941 and Q2 1942 adjacent quarters with adjustments for Q1 1942 transition period. Personnel reduced ~5% from Q4 1941 for post-siege casualties/medical evacuations. Equipment reduced 10-15% reflecting siege losses and wear. Supply/logistics improved reflecting base area reconstitution. Weather/environment adjusted for Syria location vs Tobruk. Historical notes emphasize rest/reconstitution nature of Q1 1942 - division not operationally deployed. Confidence reduced to 78% (Tier 2) due to estimation methodology and limited specific Q1 1942 documentation in accessible sources."
