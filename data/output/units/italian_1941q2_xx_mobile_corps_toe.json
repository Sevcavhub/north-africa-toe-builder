Operational effectiveness improved through quarter as tank strength rebuilt (75-85 to 99+ M13/40 tanks) and mechanical issues resolved.

The formal 'Corpo d'Armata di Manovra' was established 15 August 1941 (Q3) with addition of Trieste Division. Q2 1941 structure was effectively a reinforced division functioning as corps-level mobile reserve. Confidence reduced to 75% due to informal nature and lack of dedicated corps headquarters/assets.",
