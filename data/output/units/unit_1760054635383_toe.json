  "raw": "I notice that the template field is marked as \"null\" and the placeholder variables ({unit_designation}, {parent_unit}, {modifications}) haven't been filled in with specific values.\n\nTo create a proper unit instance, I would need:\n\n1. **Template**: A base TO&E template to work from\n2. **Unit designation**: Specific unit name/number (e.g., \"1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment\")\n3. **Parent unit**: Higher formation this unit belongs to\n4. **Modifications**: Any unit-specific changes from the template\n\nCould you please provide these details? For example:\n\n```\nTemplate: [Base template JSON or reference]\nUnit designation: \"2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment\"\nParent unit: \"1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division\"\nSpecific modifications: \"Additional sniper team, replaced one M240 with M249\"\n```\n\nOnce you provide these specifics, I can create a complete unit-specific TO&E JSON with:\n- Applied template as foundation\n- Actual commander assignments\n- Real personnel counts\n- Equipment variations\n- Parent formation references\n- Full SCM-level detail\n- Unit-specific tactical notes\n\nWould you like to provide those details so I can generate the specific unit instance?",
