All Wikipedia sources already removed in original extraction. Confidence increased from 85% to 90% due to addition of Tessin primary source and comprehensive Nafziger documentation trail.

Division severely degraded by November 1942 due to El Alamein losses and supply crisis. Tank strength catastrophic: started battle with ~85 tanks, finished with 4 operational. Supply data reflects critical October-November 1942 Mediterranean supply crisis - less than 50% of supplies reached Africa, key tankers sunk. Q4 1942 represents the division at its lowest point in the North African campaign."
