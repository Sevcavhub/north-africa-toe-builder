Aggregation method: bottom-up from subordinate corps (XXX Tier 2 84% + XIII Tier 4 45% weighted average ~70%) plus army overhead estimates. CRITICAL: X Corps absent Q2 - Eighth Army PURE INFANTRY ARMY without organic armoured corps. XXX Corps dissolved mid-April - final operations as formation. XIII Corps incomplete extraction - seed file limitation.",
