    "terrain_adaptations": "First Army adapted British doctrine for northern Tunisia mountain/hill terrain: infantry-led assaults to seize djebels (heights), artillery massed fires supporting attacks, armour in direct fire support in valleys (terrain too restrictive for mobile operations like Western Desert), extensive engineer support for road maintenance and obstacle clearance, set-piece attacks with careful planning rather than mobile warfare, methodical operations overwhelming Axis defenders through firepower superiority rather than maneuver. Contrast with Eighth Army's desert mobile warfare doctrine - First Army specialized in mountain warfare similar to Italian campaign later 1943-1945."
