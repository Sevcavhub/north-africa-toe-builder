Supported by 7th RTR Matilda tanks and massive artillery preparation. Result: Complete victory. 45,000 Italian POWs, 462 guns captured, 127 tanks captured. Australian casualties: 130 KIA, 326 WIA.\n\n**Tobruk (21-22 January 1941):** Second fortress assault. 25,000 Italian defenders in even stronger fortifications than Bardia. 16th and 17th Brigades led assault with Matilda support. Fortress fell in 36 hours. Result: 25,000 POWs, 462 guns, 236 vehicles. Australian casualties: 49 KIA, 306 WIA.\n\n**Benghazi (February 1941):** Pursuit operations. Division advanced 150 miles in 10 days. Occupied Benghazi 6 February. Completed destruction of Italian 10th Army.\n\nMorale throughout Q1 excellent. Troops confident after continuous victories. Tactical competence high - night operations, combined arms assaults, fortress warfare all executed successfully. Division earned nickname 'The Irresistible Six' from press. Withdrawn to Palestine late March for rest, refit, and redeployment (later fought in Greece, Syria, Pacific).\n\nVehicle readiness declined from 95% (January) to 90% (March) due to continuous operations and desert wear. Personnel casualties moderate (195 KIA, 452 WIA total Q1). Disease casualties (380) significant but manageable. Division remained combat-effective throughout quarter despite losses."
