Brigadier C.W. Haydon killed in action. Brigade never reformed. Remainder of division (69th and 151st Brigades) withdrew to Mersa Matruh late June and continued operations through First El Alamein (July). Division commander Maj-Gen W.H.C. Ramsden promoted to XXX Corps command July 1942. Personnel and equipment counts calculated from British infantry division TO&E standards (~17,200 establishment) adjusted for losses. Historical events and unit compositions cross-referenced across multiple sources providing high confidence despite missing Nafziger primary document."
