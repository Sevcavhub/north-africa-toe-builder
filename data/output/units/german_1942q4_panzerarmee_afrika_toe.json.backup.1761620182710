Via Balbia coastal road primary route (single-track in places, bottleneck during retreat). Western Desert: open tank country but fuel shortage negated mobility advantage.

First significant rain in months caught Axis forces unprepared - many vehicles bogged, abandoned.

    "daylight_hours": 11,
    "daylight_notes": "October: ~11.5 hours daylight. November: ~11 hours. December: ~10.5 hours. Shorter winter days limited operational tempo. Most Axis movements conducted at night to avoid RAF fighter-bombers (daylight movement suicidal under 4:1 air superiority). British searchlights and flares illuminated nighttime movements during El Alamein battle. Retreat movements primarily at night - daylight column movements annihilated by RAF.",
    "environmental_impact": "Desert conditions caused 15-20% monthly vehicle breakdown rate even without combat. Sand ingestion damaged engines despite filters. Heat exhaustion common in October despite cooler Q4 temperatures compared to summer. Water shortage critical factor affecting combat effectiveness. Flies and poor sanitation caused dysentery epidemic (estimated 20% of personnel affected). Dust storms occasionally grounded RAF (temporary operational relief). Cold nights in November-December surprised troops equipped for heat - respiratory illness increased (no winter clothing). Desert navigation difficult in featureless terrain - units frequently lost (few landmarks, map inaccuracy). Lack of cover forced extensive digging of defensive positions (rock-hard caliche layer). El Alamein minefields: over 500,000 mines laid by both sides (mine casualties significant).",
    "seasonal_notes": "Q4 represented critical seasonal transition from summer heat to winter cool/wet conditions. October still hot (temperatures favorable to British acclimated troops from Egypt). November moderate (ideal combat weather). December onset of Mediterranean winter rainy season - mud became significant factor. First major rains in months surprised Axis forces during retreat - many vehicles bogged in suddenly muddy tracks. Cooler temperatures reduced heat casualties but increased respiratory/pulmonary illness (troops lacked warm clothing). Winter rains beginning December would intensify January-March 1943 (outside Q4 scope)."

Confidence 78% reflects solid German data, estimated Italian data, well-documented battle/supply crisis.

Second Battle of El Alamein (23 Oct - 11 Nov) decisive defeat: 75% tank losses, 60% personnel casualties, total loss of offensive capability. Supply crisis THE decisive factor: 2-3 days fuel at battle start, artillery rationed to 10-15 rounds/gun/day (vs British 1 million shells prep bombardment), Mediterranean convoy losses 70%. Retreat across 1,400 miles Egypt-Libya-Tunisia: equipment abandoned en masse when fuel exhausted, rearguard actions, disorganization. By December, remnants reached Tunisian bridgehead (Operation Torch landings 8 Nov created two-front crisis). Commander succession complex: Stumme KIA 24 Oct (heart attack), Rommel recalled, von Thoma captured 4 Nov, von Vaerst acting DAK commander, Rommel flew to Germany 23 Nov (sick leave). Army effectively destroyed as coherent fighting force by end Q4. Italian divisions suffered equally or worse: Ariete destroyed (fought to last tank), Folgore destroyed (90% casualties), static divisions surrendered en masse. German equipment aggregated from divisions, Italian estimated (Phase 6 German priority). Supply/environmental/tactical doctrine heavily researched and documented from extensive historical literature.
