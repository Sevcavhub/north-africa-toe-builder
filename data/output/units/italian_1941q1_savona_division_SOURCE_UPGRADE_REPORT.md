## Confidence Assessment

### Confidence Calculation (88%)

**Primary Sources** (95% + 92% = average 93.5%):
- US G-2 Order of Battle: 95% (official US military intelligence)
- Nafziger Collection: 92% (CARL-donated primary OOB collection)

**Tier 2 Sources** (80% + 78% = average 79%):
- Rommel's Riposte: 80% (German records-based, specialist site)
- Comando Supremo: 78% (specialized Italian military history forum)

**Weighted Average**: (93.5% × 0.7) + (79% × 0.3) = 65.45% + 23.7% = **89.15%**

**Adjusted to 88%** due to:
- Known gaps in regimental commanders
- Estimated truck model breakdown
- Chief of Staff identity unknown
- Some equipment counts calculated from templates rather than specific returns

---

## Tier Classification

**Current Tier**: **Tier 1 (Production Ready)**

**Criteria Met**:
- ✅ 88% confidence (target: 85%+)
- ✅ Multiple primary sources (US G-2, Nafziger)
- ✅ Zero Wikipedia/Fandom sources
- ✅ Cross-referenced operational data
- ✅ Verified commander and unit designations
- ✅ Known gaps documented

**Qualification**: Unit qualifies for Tier 1 (75-100% complete, production_ready) with 88% confidence based on primary military intelligence and OOB collection sources.

---

## Recommendations

### For Future Enhancement (Optional)

1. **Extract Nafziger PDF**: Full text extraction of Italian_Divisions_1939-1943.pdf could provide additional structural validation
2. **Check for TM E 30-420**: If actual TM E 30-420 document is located in repository, could boost confidence to 90%+
3. **British 8th Army Records**: British operational records from Operation Crusader might provide additional equipment counts
4. **German War Diaries**: Afrika Korps daily reports (if available in Nafziger Collection) might have more precise strength returns

### No Action Required

Current sources are sufficient for Tier 1 classification. Unit data is production-ready for wargaming scenario generation.
