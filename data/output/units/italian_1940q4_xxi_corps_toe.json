Commander information partially verified: Lorenzo Dalmazzo (1 Dec 1939 - 26 Sep 1940) confirmed, Carlo Spatocco (26 Sep - 20 Dec 1940) confirmed from Wikipedia XXI Corps article. Historical role as 10th Army reserve at Tobruk/Sofafi confirmed from Operation Compass sources. Supply/logistics data ESTIMATED for reserve corps at coastal base (better than forward corps at Sidi Barrani). Weather data standard for Cyrenaica Q4 1940. This file demonstrates the NEED to extract subordinate divisions before corps-level aggregation can produce meaningful TO&E data. File included to show corps-level structure but flagged as Tier 4 (insufficient data) pending division extractions."
