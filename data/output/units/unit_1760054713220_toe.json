  "raw": "I notice that the template field is showing \"null\" and the placeholders for unit_designation, parent_unit, and modifications haven't been filled in with specific values.\n\nTo create a proper unit-specific TO&E JSON, I need:\n\n1. **Template**: The base organizational template to work from\n2. **Unit designation**: The specific unit name/number (e.g., \"1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment\")\n3. **Parent unit**: The higher formation this unit belongs to\n4. **Modifications**: Any specific changes from the template\n\nCould you please provide these details? For example:\n\n```\nTemplate: [base template JSON]\nUnit designation: \"2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment\"\nParent unit: \"1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team\"\nSpecific modifications: \"Additional sniper section, reduced mortar platoon to section\"\n```\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll create a complete unit-specific TO&E with:\n- Applied template as foundation\n- Actual commander details\n- Real personnel counts\n- Equipment variations\n- Parent formation links\n- Full SCM-level detail\n- Unit-specific tactical considerations\n\nPlease provide the missing parameters so I can generate your unit instance.",
