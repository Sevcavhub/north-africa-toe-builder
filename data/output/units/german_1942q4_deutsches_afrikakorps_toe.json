Heat exhaustion common despite cooler Q4 temperatures. Water shortage critical factor. Flies and poor sanitation caused dysentery epidemic. Dust storms occasionally grounded RAF (temporary relief). Cold nights in December surprised troops equipped for heat. Desert navigation difficult - units often lost. Lack of cover forced extensive digging of defensive positions.",

December onset of rainy season - mud became factor. Cooler temperatures reduced heat casualties but increased respiratory illness.
