Q1 1942: Rebuilding after Operation Crusader (Nov-Dec 1941) then launching surprise counter-offensive (21 Jan - 6 Feb 1942) to retake Cyrenaica.",
    "special_capabilities": [
      "Rapid exploitation of breakthroughs via two panzer divisions",
      "Mobile defensive operations using 8.8cm FlaK in AT role",

    "known_issues": [
      "Insufficient tank numbers vs British armored forces (165 tanks, down from 240 in Q2 1941 - 31% reduction)",
      "Extended supply lines (800-1000+ km from Tripoli) via single coastal road",
      "British naval/air interdiction destroys 30-40% of Axis supply convoys",
      "Desert conditions: extreme heat, sand (vehicle breakdowns), water scarcity (10-15L/man/day essential)",
      "3.7cm PaK 35/36 inadequate against Matilda II infantry tanks (78mm frontal armor)",
      "Limited spare parts (vehicles/tanks cannibalized for parts)",
      "Vulnerability of soft-skinned vehicles to British air attacks",
      "Chronic fuel shortages (5-6 days reserves, lowest of war - limits operational tempo)",
      "Italian forces require German stiffening (morale/training issues)",
      "No organic air support (dependent on Fliegerführer Afrika at theater level)",
      "Post-Crusader attrition: Tank strength 165 (Q1) vs 240 (Q2 1941), truck operational readiness 80% (Q1) vs 91% (Q2 1941)",
      "British air superiority growing (Malta-based RAF raids on supply convoys)"

Q1 1942: Emphasis on rapid repairs to restore tank strength after Crusader losses."
