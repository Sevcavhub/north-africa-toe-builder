Auchinleck's direct command after Gazala defeat stabilized situation. El Alamein defensive line geographically perfect (Qattara Depression prevents southern outflanking). Sherman tanks began arriving late July 1942 (game-changer: 75mm gun, reliable, superior armor). Supply situation dramatically improved vs Q2 due to proximity to Alexandria (60 miles vs Gazala 200+ miles). Set stage for Montgomery's arrival August 1942 and decisive Second Alamein (October-November 1942)."
