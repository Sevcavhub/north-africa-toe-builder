Organization and equipment estimates based on: (1) Standard Italian binary infantry division structure 1940; (2) 2nd Libyan Division as organizational template with adjustments for metropolitan vs colonial status; (3) TM E 30-420 Italian division tables. Metropolitan divisions typically had ~10,000-12,000 men vs ~7,000-8,000 for colonial divisions, better motorization (320 vs 175 vehicles), and more artillery (48 vs 36 guns). Confidence limited by lack of specific strength returns for Cirene in Q3 1940. Commander name not found in available sources. Division was part of Italian invasion of Egypt (September 1940) and established defensive positions at Sidi el Barrani fortified camp system."
