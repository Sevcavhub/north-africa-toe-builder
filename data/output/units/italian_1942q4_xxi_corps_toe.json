Personnel and equipment totals partially aggregated from Trento division file (10,850 personnel) plus estimated Bologna division (10,350 personnel) plus corps staff (482). Bologna Division TO&E estimated from standard Italian infantry division structure - non-motorized infantry garrisoned Naples, marched 400 miles to El Alamein July 1942. By late November 1942, corps ceased to exist as effective formation - Trento declared 'lost' 25 November, Bologna destroyed with bulk retreating on foot. Commander Generale Enea Navarini was one of few Italian commanders to remain with his formation throughout North African campaign (1941-1943)."
