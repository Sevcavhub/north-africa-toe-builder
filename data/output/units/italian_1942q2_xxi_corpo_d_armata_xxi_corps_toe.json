      "Personnel estimated 48,420 (2.7% increase from Q1 47,152) - modest reinforcements but STILL severely understrength (45-52% vs 100% establishment)",
      "CRITICAL CONTEXT: NARA Feb 1, 1942 document shows divisions 35-42% understrength - Q2 estimate 45-52% based on documented reinforcement convoys but no exact source",
      "Gazala battle (26 May - 21 June 1942): XXI Corps held static positions while German 'left hook' swept around Bir Hakeim southern flank",
      "British breakthrough (14-21 June 1942): XXI Corps defenses penetrated by British armor, divisions collapsed/disintegrated",
      "47/32 AT guns INADEQUATE vs British Grant tanks - when Grants penetrated Gazala Line, Italian AT guns virtually useless",
      "Historical significance: XXI Corps collapse June 1942 demonstrated Italian infantry divisions unable to conduct mobile defense or withstand British armored breakthrough",
      "Tier 2 status due to estimated division strengths Q2 (vs documented Q1 Feb 1 1942 NARA data) and lack of detailed Q2 division TO&E extractions"
