The unit withdrew to Egypt on June 10-11, 1942 after a heroic 15-day defense, having suffered approximately 900 casualties (141 dead, 229 wounded, 814 captured/missing during breakout) and losing 52 guns and 250 vehicles. The surviving 2,700 troops spent July-September in recovery, receiving replacements, new equipment, and training in preparation for the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 1942). The 13e DBLE (13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade) consolidated from two battalions into one due to heavy losses, with the 1st Battalion being reconstituted.",
    "designation_note": "During 1942-Q3, this force was officially designated '1re Brigade Française Libre' (1st Free French Brigade), not yet a division. The formal division designation '1re Division Française Libre' (1st Free French Division) was not adopted until February 1, 1943 when three brigades were combined. This extraction uses the division designation for consistency with the seed file naming convention.",
    "bir_hakeim_aftermath": "The Battle of Bir Hakeim made the Free French forces world-famous. General de Gaulle declared: 'When, at Bir Hakeim, a ray of renascent glory came to caress the bloody forehead of her soldiers, the world recognized France.' Despite the glory, the unit paid a heavy price and required three months of reorganization before returning to offensive operations at El Alamein in October 1942.",
    "organizational_changes": "The most significant organizational change in Q3 was the consolidation of the 13e DBLE from two battalions (2nd and 3rd) into a single battalion (2nd Battalion) due to casualties. The 1st Battalion was being reconstituted with new recruits and would rejoin the unit before El Alamein. Other battalions absorbed replacements while maintaining their organizational structure.",
    "equipment_replacements": "British Eighth Army provided replacement equipment through Cairo supply depots. French 75mm guns lost at Bir Hakeim were partially replaced with British 25-pounder gun-howitzers, improving firepower. The 1er Régiment d'Artillerie was reorganized with English equipment including four batteries with four 88mm guns and a 140mm battery. Trucks, armored cars, and support vehicles were gradually replaced, but the unit did not reach full equipment strength until Q4 1942 after receiving additional allocations.",
    "preparation_for_alamein": "While Q3 was primarily focused on recovery, the unit was preparing for participation in the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 24, 1942). Lieutenant-Colonel Amilakvari would be killed in action on October 24, 1942, the first day of the El Alamein offensive, leading the 13e DBLE in combat while commanding Groupement A of the 1st Free French Brigade in the assault on Himeimat hill.",
