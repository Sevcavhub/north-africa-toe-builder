Limited water sources beyond wells at Gharyan and coastal settlements. Sandstorms intermittent. Heat exhaustion concerns reduced by elevation and September cooling. Improved weather conditions for operations in late Q3.",

Elevation (~700m) offered cooler temperatures and healthier garrison conditions. Coastal defense sector at Sabratha-Sorman featured flat terrain favoring observation but lacking natural obstacles. Auto-transportable division could rapidly deploy from Gharyan to coastal positions (50km, ~2-3 hours).",

Limited anti-tank capability (only 8x 47mm guns) inadequate against heavier French tanks. Weak AA defense (8x 20mm guns) insufficient against potential French air superiority.

Well-trained and equipped formation sent to Libya shortly after formation (1939).
