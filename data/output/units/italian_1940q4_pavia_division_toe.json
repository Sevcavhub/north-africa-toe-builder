While other Italian Tenth Army divisions (Cirene, Catanzaro, Marmarica, Libyan divisions) were destroyed at Sidi Barrani and Bardia in Operation Compass (December 1940-February 1941), Pavia remained in XXI Corps (initially misidentified as XX Corps in some sources) reserve in Tripolitania. This positioning allowed the division to survive intact and be committed later during the siege of Tobruk (1941). Commander Pietro Zaglio confirmed from multiple primary sources: US G-2 (transcribed as 'SCATAGLIA' - Italian pronunciation/spelling variation or transcription error), Generals.dk biographical database (command dates: May 1939 - April 1941), and The Rommel Papers. Personnel totals calculated from TM 30-420 standard binary autotrasportabile division organization (~7,500 men). Vehicle counts based on autotrasportabile division tables. Artillery confirmed: 26th Artillery Regiment 'Rubicone' with 12x 100/17, 24x 75/27 (standard for binary division). Division composition from Nafziger 940ILAB matches US G-2 document exactly. Additional validation from The Rommel Papers confirms Pavia Division's deployment to Sirte-Buerat area (early 1941) and participation in XXI Corps operations during Tobruk siege. Schema v3.1.0 includes required supply_logistics and weather_environment sections for scenario generation. Enhanced confidence (92%) due to removal of Wikipedia sources and addition of authoritative military histories (Rommel Papers) plus biographical database confirmation of command dates. All Wikipedia references eliminated and replaced with primary/secondary historical sources."
