Tank variant mix (Pz III H/J, Pz IV E/F1) interpolated from Q2 1941 and Q4 1942 files with Q1 1942 as transition period (long 50mm Pz III J arriving). Commander von Vaerst appointment 1 Jan 1942 from Lexikon der Wehrmacht (replaced Neumann-Silkow KIA 9 Dec 1941). Equipment types from standard 1941-1942 Panzer division KStN tables. Supply/logistics data from Rommel Papers (fuel crisis 5-6 days, convoy interdiction 30-40%, water 10-15L/man/day). Updated to schema v3.1.0 flat structure with all required fields.
