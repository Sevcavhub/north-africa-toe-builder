ADDITIONALLY, sources CONFLICT on exact corps composition - some place Catanzaro and 3 Gennaio under XXIII Corps instead of XXII Corps. Only consistent finding: 61st Sirte Division at Tobruk under XXII Corps command. Commander Petassi Manella confirmed from web sources but appointment date unknown. Historical role as general reserve/Tobruk garrison confirmed from Operation Compass sources. Supply/logistics data ESTIMATED for fortress corps with port access (best supply situation in 10th Army). Weather data standard for Tobruk coastal region Q4 1940. This file demonstrates the NEED to (1) extract subordinate divisions and (2) resolve source conflicts on corps composition before meaningful TO&E data can be produced. File included to show corps-level structure but flagged as Tier 4 (insufficient data) pending division extractions and OOB clarification."
