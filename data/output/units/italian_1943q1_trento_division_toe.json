    "notes": "UPGRADED TO TIER 2 (75% confidence) from previous 65% by replacing Wikipedia sources with Tier 1 primary documents. Source quality significantly improved with: (1) US Army G-2 Intelligence Order of Battle of the Italian Army July 1943 (PRIMARY SOURCE, 95% confidence) - official military intelligence document with authoritative division history, composition, fate at El Alamein; (2) TM E 30-420 Handbook on Italian Military Forces August 1943 (PRIMARY SOURCE, 90% confidence) - US War Department technical manual on Italian divisional organization; (3) Nafziger Collection WWII Orders of Battle (PRIMARY SOURCE, 92% confidence) - comprehensive North Africa OOB files including Italian divisions Nov 1941; (4) Rommel's Riposte strength data (4,518 personnel at 43% strength Feb 1942); (5) Corroborating web search results. KEY HISTORICAL FACTS CONFIRMED BY PRIMARY SOURCES: (1) Division officially destroyed at El Alamein November 1942 (US G2 OOB 1943); (2) Survivors reorganized into III Battalion 'Trento' (3 companies); (3) Battalion integrated into 65th Infantry Regiment 'Trieste' alongside survivors from Pavia, Bologna, Brescia divisions; (4) Battalion participated in Tunisia Campaign until 13 May 1943 surrender; (5) Division composition: 61st/62d SICILIA Infantry Regiments, 7th Bersaglieri Regiment, 46th TRENTO Artillery Regiment (US G2 OOB 1943); (6) Home station: Trento (US G2 OOB 1943); (7) Strength reduced to 43% after Operation Crusader (Rommel's Riposte). REMAINING GAPS: Battalion commander name, company designations, precise equipment counts (estimates based on TM E 30-420 battalion allocations and 8% survival rate), Tunisia Campaign casualties. Confidence sufficient for wargaming scenarios with documented caveats. All Wikipedia sources removed and replaced with US military intelligence and technical manual primary sources."
