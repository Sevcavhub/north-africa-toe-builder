Key primary sources: (1) TM E 30-420 Handbook on Italian Military Forces (US War Dept 1943) provides authoritative Italian Army organization, division structures, equipment specifications; (2) Christie CGSC thesis 'Fallen Eagles' (1999, DTIC ADA367611) provides detailed 10th Army order of battle appendices for September/December 1940, corps assignments, operational analysis; (3) USA HQ G2 Order of Battle (July 1943) confirms unit designations, composition, commanders. CAVEAT: This aggregation represents ONLY 5 divisions extracted so far (Ariete, Pavia, Bologna, Brescia, Savona - primarily reserve divisions in Tripolitania), NOT the full 10th Army which had 9-10 divisions total in Q4 1940. Forward divisions at Sidi Barrani front (Cirene, Catanzaro, Sirte, Sabratha, Marmarica, plus Blackshirt divisions 23 Marzo, 28 Ottobre, 3 Gennaio, plus Libyan divisions and Maletti Group) are NOT included in this aggregation. Personnel total 48,645 represents only these 5 divisions vs actual 10th Army strength ~150,000. Equipment totals similarly incomplete - only 5 divisions vs 10 total divisions. However, commander information now verified through multiple primary sources: Mario Berti appointed 30 June 1940, on sick leave 9 December 1940 when Operation Compass launched, succeeded by Gariboldi then Tellera (23 December 1940 until death at Beda Fomm). Operation Compass losses confirmed across sources: 133,298 prisoners, 420 tanks, 845 guns. Supply/logistics data averaged from 5 subordinate divisions. Weather data for North African coastal region Q4 1940. Confidence reflects high-quality primary source foundation despite incomplete divisional coverage.",
