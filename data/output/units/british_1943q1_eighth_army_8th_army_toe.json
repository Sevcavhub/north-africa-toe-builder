Led Eighth Army to decisive victory at Second Battle of El Alamein (October-November 1942), pursued Panzerarmee Afrika 1,400 miles across Libya, captured Tripoli (23 January 1943), and conducted Tunisia Campaign against Axis Mareth Line defenses (Q1 1943). Known for methodical planning, overwhelming force concentration, and refusal to attack until fully prepared. Architect of 'Left Hook' strategy at Mareth Line combining frontal assault (XXX Corps) with outflanking maneuver (X Corps / New Zealand Corps through Tebaga Gap).",

Q1 1943 marked climax of North African campaign: entry into Tunisia (January), Battle of Medenine defensive victory over Rommel (6 March), and Battle of Mareth Line assault (19-31 March). Montgomery emphasized thorough preparation, artillery superiority, and combined arms coordination."

X Corps (armoured reserve) well-supplied with fuel, ammunition, water for mobile operations. XXX Corps (infantry assault) required massive ammunition stocks for artillery bombardment. Main constraints: 600-800km still extended distance, intensive combat expected against prepared German defenses, coordination with First Army advancing from west (supply competition). Tripoli port critical - activated quickly despite German demolitions, capacity gradually increased through Q1. Forward supply dumps established near Mareth Line.

Primary mission: Break through Axis Mareth Line defenses in southern Tunisia, link up with First Army advancing from west (Operation Torch), complete destruction of Axis forces in North Africa. Montgomery's operational approach: methodical planning, overwhelming force concentration, refusal to attack until logistics adequate. Mareth Line assault (19-31 March) exemplified doctrine: two-pronged offensive combining XXX Corps frontal assault (pinning German reserves) with X Corps / New Zealand Corps 'Left Hook' outflanking maneuver through Tebaga Gap.
