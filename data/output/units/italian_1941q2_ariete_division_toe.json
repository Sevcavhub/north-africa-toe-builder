The division was rebuilding after catastrophic losses at Beda Fomm (February 1941) where it lost most of its tanks and suffered heavy casualties. During this quarter, the division participated in the Siege of Tobruk while simultaneously receiving new equipment and personnel from Italy. Strength estimates reflect a division at approximately 70% of authorized establishment, gradually building toward the 146-tank strength it would achieve by November 1941. The division would undergo major reorganization on 1 September 1941 when the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment was formed with three battalions of M13/40 tanks (VII, VIII, IX battalions). Equipment shortages, particularly in motor transport and spare parts, were chronic problems for Italian mechanized units in the desert environment."
