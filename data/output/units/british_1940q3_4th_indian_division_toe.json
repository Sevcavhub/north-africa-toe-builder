    "historical_context": "4th Indian Division was one of the most experienced formations in Middle East Command by late 1940. Deployed from India to Egypt in Q3 1940, it conducted intensive desert training before spearheading Operation Compass in December 1940. The division's two Indian infantry brigades (5th and 11th) consisted of mixed British and Indian battalions - a standard practice for Indian Army formations. Central India Horse provided divisional reconnaissance with armored cars. The 1st Northumberland Fusiliers served as the divisional machine gun battalion with 48 Vickers medium machine guns organic. Artillery was all British RA units with modern 25-pdr gun-howitzers (recently replacing older 18-pdrs) and 2-pdr anti-tank guns. Engineer support came from four field companies and one field park company of Indian Sappers and Miners. This structure remained stable through Operation Compass, where the division distinguished itself in the capture of Sidi Barrani, Bardia, and Tobruk before being withdrawn for service in East Africa in December 1940."
