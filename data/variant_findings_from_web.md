## VARIANT CLUES FOUND (from successful web searches):

### From Jentz "Tank Combat in North Africa" (web search results):

**Initial Shipment (March 8-10, 1941)**:
- 155 tanks shipped to Tripoli
- Loss: Ship Leverkusen caught fire → **Lost 10x Pz.III + 3x Pz.IV**

**April Replacements**:
- "Ten replacement Panzer III, **a mixture of Ausf F and G models**, were requisitioned from 6. Panzer-Regiment"
- "Three new **Panzer IV Ausf E** were shipped to Libya between 10 and 14 April"

**May Arrival**:
- "A further **25 Panzer I Ausf A** arrived in Tripoli on 10 May"

### From Production/Deployment Research:

**General statement (Tank Encyclopedia)**:
- "When the first German forces came in Africa in March 1941, they were equipped with the Panzer II and III, **most of which were Ausf.Fs and upgunned Ausf.Gs**"
- "5th Panzer Regiment, equipped with **71 Panzer IIIs armed with 5 cm guns**" in March 1941

**Production timelines found**:
- **Pz.III Ausf F**: Production ending May 1941 (435 total built Aug 1939-Jul 1940, Apr-May 1941)
- **Pz.III Ausf G**: Production March 1940 to May 1941 (600 built total)
- **Pz.III Ausf H**: Started late 1940/early 1941, first with 5cm gun and 60mm armor
- **Pz.III Ausf J**: Production began March 1941 (unlikely in initial shipment)
- **Pz.IV Ausf D**: Prior production, likely still in inventory
- **Pz.IV Ausf E**: Active production early 1941
- **Pz.II Ausf C**: Standard variant
- **Pz.II Ausf F**: "North Africa" model confirmed in various sources

### From Lexikon der Wehrmacht (photos/captions):
- "Panzerkampfwagen III **Ausf F**. 2. Kompanie Panzer-Regiment 5. Libya, Summer 1941"
- "Panzerkampfwagen III **Ausf. H**. Stab, II Abteilung, Panzer Regiment 5"
- "**Ausf.G**, captured by the British in North Africa (1941)"

## LOGICAL DEDUCTION (High Probability):

### Panzer I (25 units):
- **Likely: Ausf. A or B**
- Reason: Standard variants, May shipment confirmed Ausf. A
- **Confidence: 70%** (no specific source for March shipment)

### Panzer II (45 units):
- **Likely: Mix of Ausf. C and Ausf. F**
- Reason: Multiple sources mention both variants in Africa 1941
- Ausf. F specifically associated with "North Africa" models
- **Confidence: 75%** (general confirmation, no breakdown)

### Panzer III (61 units):
- **Confirmed present: Ausf. F, G, H**
- **Key finding**: "71 Panzer IIIs armed with 5 cm guns" (but we have 61 units)
- **Key finding**: "most of which were Ausf.Fs and upgunned Ausf.Gs"
- **Ausf. G**: Originally 3.7cm gun, some "upgunned" to 5cm
- **Ausf. H**: First purpose-built 5cm gun variant
- **Possible breakdown** (EDUCATED GUESS):
  - 20x Ausf. F (3.7cm)
  - 25x Ausf. G (5cm upgunned)
  - 16x Ausf. H (5cm original)
- **Confidence: 60%** (general variants confirmed, breakdown estimated)

### Panzer IV (17 units):
- **Likely: Ausf. D and/or Ausf. E**
- April replacements confirmed Ausf. E
- Ausf. D still in production/inventory
- Both had short 7.5cm KwK 37 L/24
- **Confidence: 70%** (Ausf. E confirmed for April, D likely for March)

### Panzerbefehlswagen (7 units):
- **Likely: Pz.Bef.Wg. III** (command version of Pz.III)
- Jentz mentions "three kleine Panzerbefehlswagen and four Panzerbefehlswagen"
- So: 3x kleine + 4x regular = 7 total ✓
- **Confidence: 85%** (Jentz specific about types)

## DATA GAPS REMAINING:

### CRITICAL (Need exact numbers):
1. **Pz.III Ausf breakdown**: How many F vs G vs H?
2. **Pz.III gun configuration**: How many had 3.7cm vs 5cm?
3. **Pz.II Ausf breakdown**: How many C vs F?
4. **Pz.IV Ausf breakdown**: How many D vs E?
5. **Pz.I Ausf confirmation**: Were March arrivals all Ausf. A?

### Where This Data Likely EXISTS:
1. **Jentz "Tank Combat in North Africa"** book (not just web summary)
2. **Panzer Tracts 3-2** (Pz.III Ausf E,F,G,H 1938-1941)
3. **Unit shipping manifests** (OKH deployment orders)
4. **Panzer-Regiment 5 war diary** (Kriegstagebuch)
5. **Feldgrau.net forum thread** (CAPTCHA BLOCKED - USER COULD ACCESS)
6. **Axis History Forum thread** (CAPTCHA BLOCKED - USER COULD ACCESS)
