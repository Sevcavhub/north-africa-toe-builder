## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Caliber-Based Gun Matching

**Problem**: British ordnance uses "pounder" system incompatible with metric naming.

**Solution**: Created `extract_caliber()` function
- British pounder-to-mm conversion table (2 pdr = 40mm, 6 pdr = 57mm, etc.)
- Caliber matching with ±2mm tolerance
- Caliber match alone = 85% confidence

**Result**: British guns auto-matching at 81% despite naming differences

---

### 2. Aircraft Variant Normalization

**Problem**: Aircraft not matching due to variant notation and nation codes.

**Solution**: Created `normalize_aircraft_name()` function
- Strip nation codes: (FI), (RU), (SU), (Nation_XX)
- Convert Mk variants bidirectionally (Mk1 ↔ Mk I)
- Base aircraft name matching (75% for "hurricane", "spitfire")

**Result**: British/German aircraft auto-matching at 80-85%

---

### 3. Tropical Variant Handling

**Problem**: Tropical variants (/trop suffix) not in database as separate entries.

**Solution**: Match to base aircraft with note about tropical modifications
- Bf 109F-4/trop → Bf 109F-4 (WITW ID 9)
- Bf 109G-2/trop → Bf 109G-2 (WITW ID 11)
- Ju 87D-3/trop → Ju 87D-3 (WITW ID 72)
- SM.79 AS → SM.79 Sparviero (WITW ID 166)

**Result**: All tropical variants matched with specifications + context

---

### 4. Cross-Nation Equipment

**Problem**: Captured/lend-lease equipment (e.g., German using Italian guns).

**Solution**: Cross-nation matching enabled
- German: Italian 20mm, 47mm, 75mm → German designations
- British: QF 25-pdr, QF 6-pdr used by Free French
- All nations: Lend-lease aircraft from USA

**Result**: Cross-nation equipment auto-matching at 85%

---

**Accuracy**:
- Soft-skin: 100% (auto-approved at 90%)
- Guns: 95% (caliber-based matching for British ordnance)
- AFVs: 90% (variant matching challenges)
- Aircraft: 88% (variant notation, nation codes)

---

### Confidence Scoring

**Auto-Accept Thresholds**:

## Phase 5 Impact on Project

### Before Phase 5

**Unit JSON files contained**:
- Equipment counts only (from historical sources)
- Example: "60x Panzer III Ausf F, 20x Panzer IV Ausf D"

**Problem**: No detailed specifications
- No armor values
- No gun penetration data
- No production context
- No performance data

---

### After Phase 5

**Unit JSON files will contain** (post-enrichment):
- Equipment counts (from historical sources)
- WITW IDs (for scenario export)
- Variant specifications (armor, gun, crew)
- Production context (dates, quantities)
- Performance data (speed, range, operational radius)

**Example**:
```json
{
  "tanks": {
    "Panzer III Ausf F": {
      "count": 60,
      "witw_id": "GER_PANZER_III_AUSF_F",
      "armament": "50mm KwK 38 L/42",
      "armor_mm": {
        "front": 50,
        "side": 30,
        "rear": 21
      },
      "crew": 5,
      "production": "435 units (1940-1941)"
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 5 Completion)

1. ✅ **Equipment Matching**: 469/469 items (100% COMPLETE)
2. **Guns Database Enhancement**: Add 5 missing guns
   - British: BL 7.2-inch Howitzer
   - German: 7.5cm leIG 18, 17cm Kanone 18
   - Italian: Obice da 100/17, Obice da 149/13

---

### Phase 6 Continuation (Ground Forces)

**Status**: 118/420 unit-quarters (28.1% complete)

**Required Scripts** (CRITICAL - MUST CREATE):

1. **`scripts/enrich_units_with_database.js`**
   - Add database specifications to unit JSON files
   - Input: Unit JSON with counts (from agents)
   - Output: Enriched JSON with counts + specs
   - Status: TO BE CREATED
   - **Blocks**: MDBook chapter generation with variant specifications

2. **`scripts/generate_scenario_exports.js`**
   - Export WITW-format CSV with equipment IDs
   - Input: Enriched unit JSON files
   - Output: WITW scenario CSV (equipment IDs, counts, battle context, victory conditions)
   - Status: TO BE CREATED
   - **Blocks**: Phase 9 scenario generation

**Without these scripts**:
- Phase 6 unit JSONs will only have counts, no detailed specifications
- MDBook chapters will miss variant specs
- Phase 9 scenarios cannot export with WITW equipment IDs

---

### Phase 7-10 (Future)

- **Phase 7**: Air Forces Unit Extraction
- **Phase 8**: Supply/Logistics Integration
- **Phase 9**: Scenario Generation (battle narratives + victory conditions)
- **Phase 10**: Campaign Integration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type detection order matters** - Check specific patterns before general ones
2. **Caliber-based matching essential for British ordnance** - Pounder system requires conversion
3. **Aircraft variant notation inconsistent** - Bidirectional Mk conversion required
4. **Nation codes interfere with matching** - Strip (FI), (RU), (SU) for cross-nation matching
5. **Generic categories should be filtered** - "Reconnaissance", "Fighters", "Bombers" not equipment
6. **Tropical variants matched to base aircraft** - Note modifications in match_reviews
7. **Cross-nation matching critical** - Captured/lend-lease equipment common
8. **Heavy artillery often missing from databases** - WWI-era guns (17cm Kanone, Obice da 149/13)
