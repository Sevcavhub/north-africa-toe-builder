## Filtered Items

**Reconnaissance** (GER_RECONNAISSANCE)
- Generic category, not specific equipment
- Same as British "Reconnaissance" - should be excluded
- Status: Rejected

**Total Light Tanks** (GER_TOTAL_LIGHT_TANKS)
- Summary category
- Status: Auto-filtered

**Total Tanks** (GER_TOTAL_TANKS)
- Summary category
- Status: Auto-filtered

**Total Armored Cars** (GER_TOTAL_ARMORED_CARS)
- Summary category
- Status: Auto-filtered

## Skipped Aircraft (Low Confidence)

5 aircraft items were skipped due to confidence <80%:

- Dive Bombers (generic category)
- Fighters (generic category)
- Transport (generic category)
- Junkers Ju 87B-2 (not found in database)
- Messerschmitt Bf 109E-4 (not found in database)

**Note**: Generic categories ("Dive Bombers", "Fighters", "Transport") should be filtered out like "Reconnaissance". The two specific aircraft (Ju 87B-2, Bf 109E-4) may need to be added to the database if they appear in scenario requirements.

## Cross-Nation Equipment

**Italian captured equipment successfully matched**:

- Italian 20mm → 2.0cm Flak 28 Oerlikon L/70 (85%)
- Italian 47mm → 4.5cm Pak 184(r) (85%)
- Italian 75mm → 7.5cm FK38 (85%)

**Note**: Cross-nation matching system working correctly - German units using captured Italian guns auto-matched to German designations.

## Database Updates

### Match Reviews Table

98 German equipment items added to match_reviews table with:
- Canonical IDs (GER_*)
- WITW names
- Review status (approved/needs_research/rejected)
- Reviewer notes (matching logic + specifications)
- Confidence scores
- Reviewed timestamps

**Final Counts**:
- Approved: 87 (88.8%)
- Needs research: 7 (7.1%)
- Pending: 3 (3.1%)
- Rejected: 1 (1.0%)

## Next Steps

1. **Italian Equipment**: 74 items (final nation)
2. **Guns Database Enhancement**: Add leIG 18 and 17cm Kanone 18
3. **Aircraft Database Additions** (optional): Ju 87B-2, Bf 109E-4 if needed
4. **Create Enrichment Scripts**: After all matching complete (469/469 items)

## Technical Notes

### Tropical Variants
- Tropical variants (/trop suffix) matched to base aircraft in database
- WITW game treats trop variants as separate units due to different availability/deployment
- Database specifications apply to both standard and tropical variants
- Tropical modifications noted in match_reviews for historical accuracy

### Heavy Artillery
- 17cm Kanone 18 is one of the heaviest guns in German arsenal
- Corps-level asset (not division-level)
- Important for siege warfare and counter-battery fire
- May only appear in specific scenarios (Tobruk, El Alamein)
