Transport crisis well-documented: worsened from 37% operational (Q3) to ~33% (Q4) due to desert wear and limited maintenance. Personnel strength based on standard autotrasportabile division establishment (~10,500 men). Equipment breakdown based on standard Italian infantry division TO&E with noted deficiencies (same as Q3). Combat rating remained very poor (morale 4/10) despite 6 months deployment - static defense provided limited combat experience improvement. Division operational history Q4: static defense at Buqbuq (Oct-Dec 9), British penetration during Operation Compass (Dec 9-10), retreat to Bardia (Dec 13-15), destroyed January 5, 1941. Confidence 80% - good organizational, commander, and historical data; limited primary sources for exact equipment operational counts (estimated from documented overall rates)."
