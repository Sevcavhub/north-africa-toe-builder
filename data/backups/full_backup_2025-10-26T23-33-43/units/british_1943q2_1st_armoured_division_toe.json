Operations and dates well documented. Equipment transition (Crusaders/Grants to Shermans) clearly established. April 1943 reorganization (armoured division structure change) noted but implementation timing slightly uncertain. Overall excellent source base. Tier 2 (review recommended) due to estimated vehicle counts and lack of subordinate commanders, but operational history and unit composition highly reliable."
