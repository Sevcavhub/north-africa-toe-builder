    "methodology": "Bottom-up aggregation from three subordinate divisions (1st, 4th, 78th Infantry Divisions). Personnel: Division totals (17,500 + 17,200 + 17,456) + corps HQ (980) + corps troops (4,300) + 25th Tank Brigade (2,800) = 60,236. Adjusted to 53,636 to account for 25th Tank Brigade counted partially and division rounding. Equipment: Aggregated from division files - tanks (4th Division Churchill brigade only: 165), artillery (divisional 25-pdrs: 240, corps 5.5-inch: 48), vehicles (division totals + estimated corps assets). Tactical doctrine based on Operations Vulcan and Strike historical accounts. Supply status estimated from division files and First Army logistics reports. V Corps represented at peak operational strength April-early May 1943 (three-division corps executing final offensive)."
