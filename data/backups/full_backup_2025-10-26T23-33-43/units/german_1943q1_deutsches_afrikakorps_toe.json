Combined Allied superiority approximately 5:1 in personnel, 4:1 in tanks, overwhelming air superiority (RAF/USAAF total dominance, negligible Luftwaffe presence).

Panzerarmee, facing US II Corps and British First Army. Limited coordination between sectors due to terrain compartmentalization and Allied pressure. February Kasserine offensive represents last DAK offensive action - achieved tactical surprise and initial success but insufficient resources for strategic impact. March focus shifts to Mareth Line defense and subsequent withdrawal to Wadi Akarit. Gradual attrition continues - each engagement reduces irreplaceable tanks and vehicles. Allied air superiority prevents daylight movement, reducing DAK operational tempo. Supply crisis worsening monthly as Allied blockade intensifies.",

Montgomery methodical and cautious, building overwhelming force before Mareth assault. (2) US II Corps under General Lloyd Fredendall (until late February), then General George Patton - initially inexperienced (Kasserine defeat) but rapidly improving with better leadership (Patton), training, and equipment. (3) British First Army under General Kenneth Anderson - experienced British and French colonial troops. Combined Allied force coordination improving under General Harold Alexander (overall ground commander).
