Historical context from web searches, British Military History website, and battle orders showing XIII Corps NOT at Mareth Line. Tier 4 classification due to: out-of-theater location (Syria, not Tunisia), incomplete subordinate units (only 1 division vs typical 2-3), no combat operations Q1 1943, missing supply/environment data (not applicable for garrison duty). Aggregation method: bottom-up from single subordinate division (Tier 4 source) plus corps overhead estimates. CRITICAL: Seed file lists 'Tunisia' for XIII Corps but historical evidence shows corps in Syria Q1 1943.",
