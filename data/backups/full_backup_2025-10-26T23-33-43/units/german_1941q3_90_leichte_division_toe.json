Formation history well-documented: hastily assembled August-November 1941 from units already in North Africa. Commander Max Sümmermann confirmed with dates. Component units identified: Schützen-Regiment 155, Afrika-Regiment 361 (former Foreign Legion), artillery battalions, reconnaissance company, AT battalion, engineers, signals. Personnel strength (~10,500) consistent across sources. Equipment counts estimated from light division establishments and theater constraints. Key gaps: subordinate commander names, detailed tactical dispositions, exact equipment allocations. Suitable for wargaming scenarios with caveats about division's gradual formation and weak motorization.",
