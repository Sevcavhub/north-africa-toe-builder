Spare parts situation slightly improved with focused workshop efforts during static period. Tank operational readiness improved to 75-80% (vs 65% Q1). Capture of Tobruk (21 June 1942) yielded massive British supply dumps: 2,000 tons food, 1,400 tons fuel, 5,000 tons ammunition - temporarily eased crisis.

Heat caused increased engine overheating, tire failures, ammunition cook-offs in exposed vehicles. Metal surfaces reached 70-80°C - crews required gloves to avoid burns. Minimal natural concealment except wadis. RAF air supremacy forced movement at dawn/dusk or night - daylight movement invited air attack. Gazala offensive (26 May start) timed for cooler spring conditions but June pursuit occurred in building summer heat.

Encountered Free French resistance but bypassed main defenses, advancing north behind British lines. 27-28 May: Heavy tank battles in 'Cauldron' area. Ariete engaged British 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades. Italian M13/40 and M14/41 tanks comprehensively outclassed by new American M3 Grant medium tanks (75mm gun, 50mm armor). Suffered heavy tank losses but held positions. Semovente 75/18 SPGs proved valuable - HEAT rounds could defeat Grants at close range. 29 May - 5 June: Defensive fighting in 'Cauldron' as British counter-attacked. Rommel concentrated forces, Ariete held defensive box under intense pressure. British attacks costly and eventually repulsed. 6-10 June: Breakout from Cauldron, Ariete advanced northward with DAK against British armor reserves. Tank strength reduced to ~45 operational medium tanks (from 68 pre-offensive). 10-13 June: Final assault on Bir Hakeim. Ariete's 8th Bersaglieri Regiment heavily engaged vs Free French defenders. Bitter fighting, hand-to-hand combat. French evacuated night 10/11 June after heroic 15-day defense. Ariete suffered 280 casualties taking Bir Hakeim. Victory opened road to Tobruk.",
