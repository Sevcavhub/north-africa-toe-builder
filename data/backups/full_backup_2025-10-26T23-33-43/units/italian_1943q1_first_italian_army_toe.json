Formed from remnants of Italian forces that survived El Alamein defeat and long retreat to Tunisia, plus French colonial forces that joined Allies after Operation Torch. Army subordinate to Heeresgruppe Afrika (Army Group Africa) under German command (General von Arnim, then Field Marshal Rommel). Primary mission: Defend Tunisia bridgehead against converging Allied offensives from east (British 8th Army) and west (British First Army, US II Corps). X Corps defended Mareth Line in south against Montgomery's 8th Army. XIX Corps (French) defended central sector against German counteroffensives and Allied advances. Army served as holding force while Germans conducted mobile operations with panzer divisions. Strategic context: Tunisia was final Axis stand in North Africa - ultimate defeat inevitable but延ong defense tied down Allied forces and delayed invasion of Sicily/Italy.",

Italian troops trained for desert heat struggled with cold wet conditions. French colonial troops better adapted to Mediterranean climate but less experienced against German armor.
