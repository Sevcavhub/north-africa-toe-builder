    "methodology": "Data compiled from primary historical sources (Australian War Memorial, US Army CSI historical study) and secondary sources (military history websites, regimental histories). Personnel totals based on verified ~14,000 Australian garrison strength at Tobruk. Equipment counts derived from historical documentation of siege defenses (48 field guns, 113 AT guns, 60 tanks). Brigade/battalion structure verified from multiple independent sources. Supply and environmental data based on siege conditions and North African Q4 climate. Confidence reduced to 82% due to some estimated vehicle counts and minor gaps in subordinate unit commanders."
