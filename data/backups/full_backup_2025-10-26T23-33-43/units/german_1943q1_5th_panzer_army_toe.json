Compartmentalized, restrictive terrain limits classic German mobile operations (flanking maneuvers, desert navigation, rapid repositioning). Weather favors defense over offense - mud restricts attacker mobility, mountains provide defensive positions. German tactical advantages (crew quality, tank gunnery, combined arms) remain but strategic mobility negated. 5. Panzerarmee forced to fight attritional defensive battle (Allied strength) vs mobile maneuver warfare (German strength). Eastern Dorsal mountains become critical defensive barrier - Kasserine Pass offensive attempts to exploit passes but supply crisis prevents breakthrough. Overall: terrain and weather compound German supply disadvantages, favor Allied methodical approach."

Panzer-Division experienced from Eastern Front but lacking desert/North African experience - learns rapidly under von Manteuffel's leadership. Hermann Göring Division (Kampfgruppe Schmid) partially deployed, inexperienced, lacks tanks - fights primarily as heavy infantry with strong flak support. Italian divisions variable quality - some (Superga) veteran and capable, others (Pistoia, La Spezia) newly deployed with limited combat experience. Overall morale declining as strategic situation deteriorates - no prospect of victory or evacuation, only gradual attrition toward inevitable surrender. Equipment serviceability declining due to constant operations, maintenance challenges, parts shortages, and fuel restrictions limiting movement for maintenance. Supply crisis most critical factor - limits offensive operations to 2-3 days duration (Kasserine Pass example). Defensive operations viable but attrition unsustainable. Assessment: Army retains dangerous tactical capability (Kasserine Pass inflicted 6,500 US casualties) but lacks strategic resources for decisive action. Countdown to collapse as Allied pressure intensifies and supply situation worsens."
