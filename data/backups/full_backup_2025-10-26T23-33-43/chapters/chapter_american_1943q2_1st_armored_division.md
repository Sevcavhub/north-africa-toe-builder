# 1st Armored Division "Old Ironsides"

**United States Army Forces • 1943 Q2 (April-June) • Tunisia, North Africa**

---

## Division Overview

The 1st Armored Division, nicknamed "Old Ironsides," was the first American armored division to see combat in World War II, entering action in North Africa in November 1942 during Operation Torch. By the second quarter of 1943, the division had recovered from its defeat at Kasserine Pass in February and emerged as a battle-hardened, effective fighting force that played a crucial role in the final defeat of Axis forces in Tunisia.

Commanded by Major General Ernest N. Harmon since March 1943, the division was reorganized into three flexible Combat Commands (CCA, CCB, and CCC) that could be task-organized for specific missions. This proved highly effective during the final Tunisia offensive in April-May 1943, when the division spearheaded attacks toward Mateur, captured key terrain including Hill 315 and Hill 299, and helped seal the fate of Axis forces in North Africa.

The division's strength at this time was approximately 14,620 personnel equipped with 232 tanks (primarily M4 and M4A1 Shermans with some M3 Stuarts), 542 halftracks, 72 self-propelled and towed artillery pieces, and extensive supporting vehicles. Its subordinate units included two tank regiments (1st and 13th Armored), the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment, reconnaissance, artillery, engineer, and support battalions.

### M4 Sherman - 92 tanks

The M4 Sherman with 75mm gun was the primary medium tank of the 1st Armored Division. These early production models featured a welded hull with cast turret and proved mechanically reliable in the harsh North African environment.

**Specifications**:
- **Main Gun**: 75mm M3 gun
- **Armor**: 51mm frontal hull, 76mm frontal turret
- **Crew**: 5 (commander, gunner, loader, driver, co-driver/bow gunner)
- **Speed**: 38 km/h on roads
- **Weight**: 30.3 tons

**Combat Performance**: The Sherman's 75mm gun was adequate against Italian and early German tanks but struggled against the German 88mm anti-tank gun and the Panzer IV's long 75mm gun. However, the Sherman's reliability, good cross-country mobility, and gyrostabilized gun gave American crews significant advantages. The tank's high silhouette was a disadvantage in the open Tunisian terrain. Operational readiness of 87% was excellent for desert conditions.

---

### M4A1 Sherman - 76 tanks

The M4A1 variant featured a fully cast hull, distinguishing it from the welded M4. Otherwise, specifications and performance were nearly identical to the M4.

**Specifications**:
- **Main Gun**: 75mm M3 gun
- **Armor**: 51mm frontal hull, 76mm frontal turret
- **Crew**: 5
- **Speed**: 38 km/h on roads
- **Weight**: 30.3 tons

**Combat Performance**: The cast hull of the M4A1 provided slightly better protection against shaped-charge weapons but was otherwise equivalent to the welded M4. Both variants served interchangeably in tank battalions. The 85.5% operational readiness reflected normal maintenance challenges with cast hull components in desert conditions.

---

### M3 Stuart (late production) - 54 tanks

The M3 Stuart light tank equipped the 81st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and light tank companies of the tank regiments. These late-production models featured improved suspension and turret design.

**Specifications**:
- **Main Gun**: 37mm M6 gun
- **Armor**: 44mm maximum (frontal turret)
- **Crew**: 4 (commander, gunner, driver, co-driver)
- **Speed**: 58 km/h on roads
- **Weight**: 12.9 tons

**Combat Performance**: The Stuart's 37mm gun was obsolete against German medium tanks but remained effective against Italian light armor and for reconnaissance missions. High speed and good reliability made it ideal for screening and scouting operations. The 77.8% operational readiness reflected the wear on these vehicles from intensive reconnaissance duties.

---

### M5 Stuart - 10 tanks

The M5 Stuart represented the next generation of American light tanks with automotive improvements including twin Cadillac engines and improved crew ergonomics.

**Specifications**:
- **Main Gun**: 37mm M6 gun
- **Armor**: 44mm maximum (frontal turret)
- **Crew**: 4
- **Speed**: 58 km/h on roads
- **Weight**: 14.7 tons

**Combat Performance**: The M5 featured better automotive reliability than the M3 but mounted the same inadequate 37mm gun. By mid-1943, these were primarily used for reconnaissance and command tasks where firepower was less critical than mobility and protection. Limited numbers (10 tanks) suggest these were newly arrived replacements.

---

## Artillery Strength

The division's artillery consisted primarily of the excellent M7 Priest 105mm self-propelled howitzer, providing mobile fire support that could keep pace with armored maneuver elements. Three battalions of M7s (54 guns total) formed the core divisional artillery, supplemented by towed 105mm and 155mm howitzers for general support.

### M7 Priest 105mm SPG - 54 guns

The M7 Priest was the premier self-propelled artillery piece of the US Army in 1943, providing mobile, protected fire support that revolutionized armored division artillery operations.

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 105mm howitzer M2A1
- **Range**: 11,200 meters
- **Projectile Weight**: 14.97 kg (HE)
- **Rate of Fire**: 4 rounds per minute sustained
- **Chassis**: M3 medium tank chassis
- **Armor**: 12-62mm
- **Crew**: 7

**Combat Performance**: The M7 Priest was highly effective in Tunisia, providing responsive indirect fire support that could displace rapidly to keep pace with armored advances. The 105mm howitzer was deadly against infantry, unarmored vehicles, and field fortifications. The open-topped fighting compartment (protected by .50 cal machine gun) was vulnerable to airburst artillery and mortar fire but allowed excellent crew situational awareness. Three battalions (27th, 68th, 91st Armored Field Artillery Battalions) provided 54 guns total, organized into 18-gun battalions.

---

### M2A1 105mm Howitzer (towed) - 12 guns

Standard US Army towed 105mm howitzer, providing general support fires and supplementing the M7 Priest battalions.

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 105mm
- **Range**: 11,200 meters
- **Projectile Weight**: 14.97 kg (HE)
- **Rate of Fire**: 4 rounds per minute sustained
- **Weight**: 2,030 kg (in action)
- **Tow Vehicle**: 2.5-ton 6x6 truck

**Combat Performance**: Identical ballistics to the M7 Priest but less mobile due to towed configuration. Used primarily for defensive fires and situations where the Priest's mobility was less critical. The towed configuration required more time to emplace and displace, limiting responsiveness during mobile operations.

---

### M1 155mm Howitzer (towed) - 6 guns

Heavy divisional artillery providing long-range fire support and counterbattery missions.

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 155mm
- **Range**: 14,600 meters
- **Projectile Weight**: 43 kg (HE)
- **Rate of Fire**: 1 round per minute sustained
- **Weight**: 5,800 kg (in action)
- **Tow Vehicle**: Heavy truck or M4 tractor

**Combat Performance**: The "Long Tom" 155mm howitzer provided heavy fire support beyond the range of 105mm weapons. Primarily used for counterbattery fire against German artillery, destroying fortifications, and long-range interdiction. The small number (6 guns) was typical for armored divisions, which prioritized mobility over heavy fire support.

---

### 57mm M1 Anti-Tank Gun - 54 guns

The primary American towed anti-tank gun in 1943, equipping the three armored infantry battalion companies (three guns per rifle company, 18 per battalion).

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 57mm (6-pounder)
- **Penetration**: 74mm at 1,000 meters (APCBC)
- **Range**: 5,000 meters maximum
- **Rate of Fire**: 15-20 rounds per minute
- **Weight**: 1,140 kg (in action)
- **Crew**: 6

**Combat Performance**: The 57mm M1 (US-manufactured British 6-pounder) was marginally effective against German Panzer IV and inadequate against Tigers and Panthers. However, in Tunisia in mid-1943, it was adequate against most Italian tanks and the thinner side and rear armor of German tanks. The gun's small size and relatively light weight made it suitable for halftrack towing. Each armored infantry rifle company had three guns for direct support of infantry operations.

---

### 75mm Gun (halftrack mounted) - 27 guns

Halftrack-mounted 75mm guns equipping assault gun platoons in the armored infantry battalion headquarters companies.

**Specifications**:
- **Caliber**: 75mm M1897A4 (modified French design)

- **Range**: 9,200 meters
- **Platform**: M3 halftrack
- **Crew**: 5

**Combat Performance**: The 75mm gun motor carriage provided mobile direct fire support for armored infantry, effective against field fortifications, buildings, and light armor. The weapon was less effective as an anti-tank gun compared to dedicated tank destroyers but provided valuable infantry support. Three assault gun platoons (nine guns per armored infantry battalion) gave 27 guns total across the division's three armored infantry battalions.

---

### M51 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage - 8 guns

Twin .50 caliber machine guns mounted on M3 halftrack chassis, providing mobile anti-aircraft defense.

**Specifications**:
- **Armament**: Twin .50 cal M2HB heavy machine guns
- **Rate of Fire**: 450-550 rounds per minute (per gun)
- **Effective Ceiling**: 1,500 meters
- **Platform**: M3 halftrack
- **Crew**: 4

**Combat Performance**: The M51 "Quad .50" was effective against low-flying aircraft and devastating against ground targets including infantry, unarmored vehicles, and light structures. By May 1943, Axis air superiority in Tunisia had ended, so these vehicles were often employed in ground support roles. Eight vehicles provided minimal air defense but significant additional firepower for ground operations.

---

## Armoured Cars

The division's reconnaissance squadron operated 48 armored cars in two types: the M8 Greyhound (6-wheeled armored car with 37mm gun) and the M20 Scout Car (armored utility vehicle).

| Type | Count | Role | Unit |
|------|-------|------|------|
| **Total Armoured Cars** | **48** | - | - |
| ↳ M8 Greyhound | 32 | Reconnaissance, 37mm gun | 81st Cavalry Recon Squadron |
| ↳ M20 Scout Car | 16 | Armored utility, command | 81st Cavalry Recon Squadron |

- .30 cal M1919A4 coaxial machine gun
- .50 cal M2HB machine gun (ring mount)

**Armor**: 19mm maximum  
**Crew**: 4 (commander, gunner, driver, radio operator)  
**Speed**: 89 km/h on roads

**Combat Record**: The M8 Greyhound proved highly effective in Tunisia for reconnaissance, screening, and pursuit operations. Its 37mm gun was adequate for engaging light armor and soft targets. Excellent road speed and good cross-country mobility made it ideal for rapid reconnaissance sweeps. The 81st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron operated 32 Greyhounds in four troops, providing the division with wide-ranging reconnaissance capability that was crucial during the fast-moving final Tunisia offensive in May 1943.

---

### M20 Scout Car - 16 vehicles

The M20 Armored Utility Car was an M8 chassis without the turret, used for command, liaison, and light scouting duties.

**Armament**:
- .50 cal M2HB machine gun (ring mount)
- Personal weapons of crew

**Armor**: 19mm maximum (identical to M8)  
**Crew**: 2 plus 4 passengers  
**Speed**: 89 km/h on roads

**Combat Record**: The M20 served primarily as command and liaison vehicles for reconnaissance squadron headquarters and as light scout cars. The open-topped design allowed excellent observation but provided less protection than the M8. These vehicles were essential for command and control of dispersed reconnaissance elements during mobile operations.

### M3A1 Halftrack (unarmed) - 380 vehicles

The workhorse armored personnel carrier of the US Army, the M3A1 halftrack transported the division's three armored infantry battalions into combat.

**Capacity**: 10-13 troops plus crew  
**Armament**: Varies by role (typically .50 cal M2HB and .30 cal M1919A4)  
**Armor**: 6-13mm  
**Crew**: 2 (driver, assistant driver)  
**Speed**: 72 km/h on roads

**Role**: The M3A1 provided armored mobility for infantry, allowing them to accompany tanks across hostile terrain and dismount for assault under armor protection. Each armored infantry battalion fielded approximately 126 halftracks organized into rifle companies (20 per company) and headquarters elements. The halftrack's cross-country mobility was good but inferior to tracked vehicles. Vulnerable to mines and anti-tank weapons, the vehicle was best employed as a "battlefield taxi" rather than an assault vehicle.

## Supply & Logistics

**Supply Status**: Adequate for offensive operations by May 1943. The division had recovered from supply shortages during the Kasserine Pass period (February 1943) and established effective logistics links to ports at Oran and Algiers (250-400 km distant). Fuel, ammunition, and spare parts arrived regularly, though the division's high consumption rates (particularly fuel) required constant attention.

**Operational Radius**: 180 km from main supply depots. This reflected the division's fuel consumption (approximately 15,000 gallons per day for sustained operations) and the capacity of division transport to shuttle supplies forward. Mobile warfare in Tunisia's open terrain required careful fuel management.

**Fuel Reserves**: 8.5 days at operational consumption rates. This was adequate for sustained offensive operations but required continuous resupply. The division's 232 tanks, 542 halftracks, and 3,000+ other vehicles consumed fuel at prodigious rates during mobile operations.

**Ammunition**: 12 days of combat supplies. Artillery ammunition consumption was the primary concern, particularly for the 54 M7 Priests which could expend hundreds of rounds per day during intensive operations. Tank and small arms ammunition stocks were robust.

**Water**: 4.5 liters per person per day. Desert operations in Tunisia (particularly during April-June when temperatures exceeded 35°C) made water supply critical. The division required approximately 65,000 liters of water daily for personnel and vehicle cooling systems. Water purification and distribution were continuous operations.

**Logistics Challenges**:
- Long supply lines from coastal ports (250-400 km)
- Poor road network in Tunisia required extensive truck movement
- Dust and heat caused accelerated vehicle wear
- Spare parts for Shermans and halftracks in high demand
- Fuel consumption during mobile operations strained supply capacity

## Weather & Environment

**Season**: 1943 Q2 (April-June) - Late spring transitioning to summer

**Temperature Range**: 15°C to 38°C (59°F to 100°F)
- April: 12°C to 28°C
- May: 15°C to 33°C
- June: 18°C to 38°C

**Terrain**: Mixed terrain in Tunisia - coastal plains near Bizerte and Tunis, rocky hills (djebels) in the interior, wadis (dry riverbeds), limited desert patches. The terrain was generally more favorable for armor than the pure desert of Libya, with better roads and more cover, but hill country limited tank mobility and provided excellent defensive positions for German and Italian forces.

**Weather Conditions**: Generally dry with occasional rain showers in April transitioning to hot, dry conditions in May-June. The infamous "Ghibli" wind (hot, dust-laden wind from the Sahara) occurred occasionally, reducing visibility and causing mechanical problems from dust ingestion. Sandstorms were rare (approximately 1 day per month) but could ground aircraft and halt operations when they occurred.

**Daylight Hours**: Approximately 14 hours in late spring, providing extended time for daylight operations. This was tactically advantageous for American forces, which preferred daylight operations leveraging superior artillery and air support.

**Environmental Challenges**:
- Dust ingestion in engines and weapons required frequent cleaning and maintenance
- Heat caused crew fatigue and reduced combat effectiveness
- Water requirements for personnel and vehicles were critical
- Limited natural cover in many areas exposed vehicles to observation and fire
- Rocky terrain caused excessive track and suspension wear on tanks

## Tactical Doctrine

The 1st Armored Division employed combined arms tactics centered on the flexible Combat Command organization. Each Combat Command integrated tanks, armored infantry, self-propelled artillery, engineers, and supporting elements into a balanced task force capable of independent operations.

**Primary Roles**:
- Breakthrough operations: Penetrating enemy defensive lines
- Exploitation: Exploiting breakthrough to enemy rear areas
- Pursuit: Pursuing and destroying retreating enemy forces
- Mobile defense: Counterattacking enemy penetrations

**Tactical Innovations (Post-Kasserine)**:
- Improved tank-infantry cooperation: Infantry and tanks trained to work closely together, with infantry clearing anti-tank positions before tank advances
- Better use of terrain: Tanks learned to use hull-down positions and overwatch tactics rather than charging across open ground
- Combined arms integration: Artillery, engineers, and tank destroyers integrated at battalion level rather than division level
- Forward observer integration: Artillery forward observers rode in tanks to provide responsive fire support

**Combat Command Flexibility**: The three Combat Commands (CCA, CCB, CCC) could be task-organized rapidly for specific missions. A typical Combat Command might include:
- One tank regiment (two medium tank battalions, one light tank company)
- One armored infantry battalion
- One artillery battalion (18 guns)
- One engineer company
- Reconnaissance troop
- Tank destroyer platoon (if attached)

This flexibility allowed the division commander to create balanced forces tailored to specific tactical situations.

**Known Limitations**:
- Sherman 75mm gun inferior to German 88mm and Panzer IV long 75mm
- Sherman armor vulnerable to German anti-tank weapons
- High silhouette made Shermans vulnerable in open terrain
- Limited heavy artillery compared to infantry divisions
- Fuel consumption limited operational range
- Maintenance demands of tracked vehicles reduced operational readiness

**Desert Adaptations**:
- Sand filters on all vehicles to reduce dust ingestion
- Increased water capacity for vehicles and personnel
- Desert camouflage (tan/brown paint schemes)
- Frequent maintenance schedules (daily inspections, more frequent oil changes)
- Sun shields on tank turrets to reduce interior temperatures
- Personal equipment: sun helmets, light-colored uniforms, water bottles

## Combat Operations (1943 Q2)

### April-May 1943: Final Tunisia Offensive

Following the setback at Kasserine Pass in February 1943, the 1st Armored Division underwent reorganization under new commander MG Ernest Harmon. By April 1943, the division was ready to participate in the final Allied offensive to eliminate Axis forces in Tunisia.

**Operation Dates**: 27 April - 13 May 1943

### Battle for Mateur (27 April - 3 May 1943)

The division attacked toward the key town of Mateur as part of II Corps' offensive. Combat Command A led the assault against heavily defended German positions.

**Key Engagements**:
- **Hill 315** (1 May): CCA assaulted German positions on dominating terrain. Heavy fighting involving tanks, infantry, and artillery. Hill secured after two days of combat.
- **Hill 299** (2-3 May): CCB attacked parallel German positions. Combined tank-infantry assault with M7 Priest fire support.
- **Mateur** (3 May): Town fell to 1st Armored Division after German withdrawal from hill positions.

**Tactical Performance**: The division demonstrated improved combined arms coordination, with infantry clearing anti-tank positions before tank advances. M7 Priest self-propelled artillery proved highly effective, displacing rapidly to support attacks. Sherman tanks suffered losses to German 88mm anti-tank guns and dug-in Panzer IVs, but numerical superiority and better logistics allowed sustained pressure.

### Djebel Achtel (5-11 May 1943)

Following the capture of Mateur, the division attacked the Djebel Achtel heights, a strong German defensive position blocking the advance toward Bizerte.

**Operations**:
- Multi-day battle involving all three Combat Commands
- Difficult terrain limited tank employment
- Armored infantry fought dismounted with tank support when terrain permitted
- Artillery preparation critical to reducing defensive positions

**Results**: German positions eventually abandoned as the overall Tunisia situation collapsed. The division's pressure prevented reinforcement of other sectors.

### Ferryville (7 May 1943)

Combat Command A entered Ferryville, a port town near Bizerte, against light resistance. German forces were collapsing throughout Tunisia as supplies and reinforcements ceased.

### Final Operations (9-13 May 1943)

The division participated in pursuit operations and mopping up isolated Axis units. German and Italian forces in Tunisia surrendered on 9-13 May 1943, ending the North African campaign.

**Division Losses (April-May 1943)**:
- Tank losses: Approximately 35-40 tanks knocked out (mostly Shermans)
- Personnel: Estimated 300-400 casualties (killed, wounded, missing)
- Vehicles: Moderate losses to mines, mechanical breakdown, and enemy action

**Axis Prisoners**: The division captured thousands of German and Italian prisoners during the final collapse.

## Combat Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Excellent logistics and maintenance (84% tank operational readiness)
- Superior artillery support (54 M7 Priests plus towed guns)
- Good combined arms coordination (post-Kasserine improvements)
- Flexible Combat Command organization
- High mobility and operational tempo
- Reliable Sherman tanks (mechanically superior to German armor)

**Weaknesses**:
- Sherman gun and armor inferior to German medium/heavy tanks and AT guns
- Limited heavy artillery compared to infantry divisions
- Vulnerability to German 88mm guns
- High fuel consumption limited operational range
- Tank crews still learning optimal tactics

**Experience Level**: By May 1943, the division was "Regular" to "Veteran" depending on unit. The division had seen combat since November 1942, suffered defeat at Kasserine (February 1943), but recovered and achieved tactical competence by April-May 1943.

**Morale**: Good to high. The division had overcome the stigma of Kasserine Pass and achieved notable victories at Mateur and in the final Tunisia offensive. Confidence in equipment (especially Sherman reliability) and leadership (MG Harmon) was high.

## Wargaming Data

**Scenario Suitability**:
- Tunisia Campaign (April-May 1943)
- Battle for Mateur (27 April - 3 May 1943)
- Hill 315 and Hill 299 assaults
- Djebel Achtel offensive (5-11 May 1943)
- Ferryville capture (7 May 1943)
- Pursuit operations (May 1943)

**Morale Rating**: 7/10 - Solid morale, combat-experienced, confident in leadership

**Experience Level**: Regular (transitioning to Veteran for some units)

## Conclusion

The 1st Armored Division in the second quarter of 1943 represented American armored forces at a critical transition point. Having suffered defeat at Kasserine Pass, the division learned valuable lessons in combined arms coordination, terrain utilization, and tactical employment of armor. Under MG Ernest Harmon's aggressive leadership, the division emerged as an effective fighting force that played a major role in the final destruction of Axis forces in Tunisia.

With 14,620 personnel, 232 tanks, 542 halftracks, 72 artillery pieces, and massive supporting infrastructure, the division was a powerful combined arms force. While the Sherman tank's gun and armor were inferior to German counterparts, American advantages in logistics, maintenance, artillery support, and operational flexibility proved decisive. The division's Combat Command organization allowed flexible task-organization that adapted to changing tactical situations.

The Tunisia campaign culminated in total Axis defeat (9-13 May 1943), with the 1st Armored Division capturing thousands of prisoners and seizing key objectives including Mateur and Ferryville. The lessons learned in North Africa would shape American armored doctrine for the remainder of World War II.

**"Old Ironsides" had proven its mettle in the crucible of North African combat.**
