# British 10th Armoured Division - 1943-Q2 (April-June)

**Status**: OUT OF THEATER - Not in North Africa  
**Location**: Palestine/Syria  
**Role**: Rest, Refit, Reorganization  
**Combat Operations**: None

---

## Critical Finding

**The British 10th Armoured Division did NOT participate in North Africa combat operations during 1943-Q2 (April-June 1943).**

This extraction documents a **Tier 4 research brief** because the division was out of the North Africa theater during this period. The division's inclusion in the seed file for 1943q1-q2 appears to be an error.

## Historical Context

### Relocation from Egypt (1 January 1943)

After fighting at Alam Halfa (August 1942) and the Second Battle of El Alamein (October-November 1942), the 10th Armoured Division was **not required for the pursuit** following Montgomery's victory. The division relocated from Egypt to **Palestine on 1 January 1943** for:

- Rest and recuperation after intense combat
- Refit and equipment replacement
- Reorganization and training
- Garrison duties in the Middle East

### Tunisia Campaign (No Participation)

During 1943-Q2, the **Tunisia Campaign concluded** with Axis surrender on **13 May 1943**. However, authoritative sources confirm that **only THREE British armoured divisions** fought in Tunisia:

1. **1st Armoured Division** - Fought at Wadi Akarit, El Kourzia, final battle for Tunis
2. **6th Armoured Division** - Fought at Fondouk, El Kourzia, final battle for Tunis  
3. **7th Armoured Division** - Advanced from Libya into Tunisia under Eighth Army

**Source**: British Military History website - "Docs – Tunisia 1942-1943 – British Armoured Divisions"

The 10th Armoured Division is **notably absent** from all Tunisia Campaign order of battle documentation.

### Division Reorganization (June 1943)

On **3 June 1943**, the division underwent a significant reorganization when the **7th Armoured Brigade** joined from independent service. This brought the division up to a three-brigade establishment:

- **7th Armoured Brigade** (joined 3 June 1943)
- **24th Armoured Brigade** (remained with division)
- **8th Armoured Brigade** (status uncertain - see below)

**Source**: Wikipedia - 10th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)

### 8th Armoured Brigade Status (Uncertain)

During 1943-Q1 (January-March), the **8th Armoured Brigade was detached** from the 10th Armoured Division and fought independently in Tunisia:

- Attached to **New Zealand Corps**
- Participated in the **Battle of Mareth Line** (14-26 March 1943)
- Launched attack towards **El Hamma** on 26 March (Operation Supercharge II)
- Penetrated Switch Line and forced Axis withdrawal

After the Tunisia Campaign ended on 13 May 1943, it is **unclear** whether the 8th Armoured Brigade:
- Rejoined the parent 10th Armoured Division in Palestine/Syria, OR
- Remained as an independent formation

This gap requires further archival research to resolve.

- Previously an independent formation
- Brought additional tank strength to division
- Composition and equipment details uncertain

**24th Armoured Brigade**
- Remained with division throughout 1943
- Estimated strength: ~3,950 personnel
- Standard British armoured brigade organization

**8th Armoured Brigade** (status uncertain)
- Fought independently in Tunisia during 1943-Q1 (Mareth Line)
- Unknown whether rejoined parent division after Tunisia Campaign ended 13 May
- May have remained as independent formation

## Equipment Notes

### Sherman Allocation Increased

During the reorganization period, the division received **additional M4 Sherman II tanks** (increased to 95 from 85 in 1943q1), reflecting:
- British production/lend-lease deliveries continuing
- Phasing out of M3 Grants (reduced to 35 from 45)
- Modernization of tank fleet during refit

### Grant Tanks Phased Out

The **M3 Grant medium tanks** continued to be phased out:
- 1942q4: ~60 Grants
- 1943q1: 45 Grants  
- 1943q2: 35 Grants (estimated)

By mid-1943, British armoured divisions were transitioning to **Sherman-equipped** establishments.

### 6-Pounder Anti-Tank Guns Standard

The **Ordnance QF 6-pounder (57mm)** was now the standard divisional anti-tank gun:
- 32x 6-pounders in anti-tank regiment
- Only 4x 2-pounders remaining (down from 6 in 1943q1)
- 2-pounder nearly fully replaced by 1943q2

## Why This Division is Not in North Africa

### Operational Context

After El Alamein (October-November 1942), the **Eighth Army pursued** Rommel's forces westward across Libya into Tunisia. However, the 10th Armoured Division was **not required** for this pursuit and was instead:

1. **Withdrawn to Egypt** (December 1942)
2. **Relocated to Palestine** (1 January 1943)
3. **Designated for rest/refit** (January-June 1943)

This decision reflected:
- Sufficient armoured strength in Eighth Army (7th Armoured Division led pursuit)
- Division needed rest after intense Alam Halfa and El Alamein fighting
- Middle East garrison requirements in Palestine/Syria
- Potential future deployment elsewhere

### Tunisia Campaign Force Structure

The Tunisia Campaign (November 1942 - May 1943) involved **two British armies**:

**First Army** (landed Algeria, November 1942):
- 6th Armoured Division

**Eighth Army** (advanced from Libya):
- 1st Armoured Division
- 7th Armoured Division

The 10th Armoured Division was **not assigned to either army** for Tunisia operations.

### Division's Subsequent History

- **1943q2**: Remained in Palestine/Syria, reorganized with 7th Brigade addition
- **1943q3-q4**: Continued in Middle East (details uncertain)
- **15 June 1944**: Division **disbanded** in Egypt

The division **never returned to North Africa combat operations** after January 1943.

## Implications for Seed File

### Recommended Action

The **North Africa seed file** currently lists the 10th Armoured Division for:
- 1942-Q3 (El Alamein) ✅ CORRECT - Division fought at Alam Halfa
- 1942-Q4 (El Alamein) ✅ CORRECT - Division fought at Second El Alamein
- **1943-Q1** ❌ OUT OF THEATER - Division in Palestine (relocated 1 January)
- **1943-Q2** ❌ OUT OF THEATER - Division in Palestine/Syria (no combat)

**Recommendation**: The seed file should be updated to:
1. **Remove** 1943-Q1 and 1943-Q2 entries for 10th Armoured Division, OR
2. **Flag** these quarters as "OUT-OF-THEATER" with no combat role

### 8th Armoured Brigade Alternative

If scenarios require British armoured forces in Tunisia 1943-Q1, consider:
- **8th Armoured Brigade** (detached from 10th Armoured Division)
- Fought independently at Mareth Line (March 1943)
- Attached to New Zealand Corps
- Should be extracted as **separate independent formation** if needed

## Data Quality Assessment

### Tier 4: Research Brief Created

This extraction is classified as **Tier 4** (confidence 35%) because:

**Major Gaps**:
- Division not in North Africa theater (primary issue)
- Exact location in Palestine/Syria uncertain
- 7th Armoured Brigade integration details minimal (only join date known)
- 8th Armoured Brigade post-Tunisia status unknown
- No combat operations to document
- Supply/logistics not applicable (garrison duty)
- Weather/environment not applicable (out of theater)

**What We Know**:
- Division relocated to Palestine 1 January 1943 (confirmed)
- Division did NOT fight in Tunisia (confirmed by authoritative source)
- 7th Armoured Brigade joined 3 June 1943 (Wikipedia confirmed)
- Division disbanded 15 June 1944 in Egypt (confirmed)
- Equipment estimates based on 1943q1 baseline with adjustments

**Required for Tier 1-2**:
- Combat operations in North Africa (ABSENT - division out of theater)
- Detailed location and activities (MINIMAL - only general Palestine/Syria)
- Brigade compositions and strengths (PARTIAL - 7th/24th uncertain, 8th unknown)
- Supply and logistics data (NOT APPLICABLE - not in combat)

   - Confirms OUT-OF-THEATER status began 1 January 1943

### Source Limitations

- **No detailed unit war diaries** accessed for 1943q2 activities
- **Brigade compositions** uncertain (especially 7th Brigade post-arrival)

## Conclusion

The British 10th Armoured Division was **NOT in North Africa** during 1943-Q2 (April-June 1943). The division:

1. Relocated to **Palestine on 1 January 1943** after El Alamein
2. Spent 1943-Q2 in **rest, refit, and reorganization** in Palestine/Syria
3. Did **NOT participate in the Tunisia Campaign** (concluded 13 May 1943)
4. Received **7th Armoured Brigade** on 3 June 1943 during reorganization
5. Never returned to North Africa combat, **disbanded 15 June 1944** in Egypt

This extraction serves as a **research brief (Tier 4)** documenting the division's out-of-theater status. The seed file entry for 1943q1-q2 should be corrected to reflect the division was not engaged in North Africa operations during these quarters.

For **North Africa wargaming scenarios** in 1943-Q2, use the three British armoured divisions that actually fought in Tunisia: **1st, 6th, and 7th Armoured Divisions**.
