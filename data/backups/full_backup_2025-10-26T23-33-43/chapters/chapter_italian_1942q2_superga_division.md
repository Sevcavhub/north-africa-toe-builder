# 1a Divisione 'Superga'
**Italian Infantry Division | North Africa | April-June 1942**

---

## Executive Summary

The 1st "Superga" Division was an Italian binary infantry division deployed to North Africa in spring 1942. By mid-June 1942, the division was severely under-strength with only 4,648 personnel (approximately 45% of theoretical establishment), critically short of vehicles (60 trucks total), and equipped with obsolescent anti-tank weapons. The division participated in defensive operations during the Gazala battles and the Tobruk assault in May-June 1942.

**Combat Status (June 15, 1942):**
- Strength: 4,648 personnel (156 officers, 4,492 troops)
- Combat Effectiveness: ~45% of establishment strength
- Mobility: Severely limited (60 trucks, 528 horses, 13 motorcycles)
- AT Capability: Inadequate (22x 47/32mm guns)
- Morale: Regular, declining due to supply shortages

## I. Command & Organization

### Division Command
- **Commander:** *Research Required* - Generale di Divisione
- **Headquarters:** North Africa (specific location under research)
- **Parent Formation:** Corpo d'Armata XX (probable)
- **Staff Strength:** 156 officers, 4,492 enlisted

### Organizational Notes
The Superga Division was organized as a binary division (two infantry regiments) typical of Italian colonial formations. This structure reflected Italy's chronic shortage of equipment and personnel for North African operations. The division designation "Superga" honors the basilica near Turin.

## II. Subordinate Units

### Infantry Regiments

#### 91° Reggimento Fanteria 'Basilicata'
- **Strength:** 1,088 personnel (34 officers, 1,054 troops)
- **Status:** Critically under-strength (~42% of establishment)
- **Equipment:**
  - 128 horses
  - 2 motorcycles, 6 bicycles
  - 4x 47/32mm AT guns
  - 24 submachine guns (Beretta M38)
  - 12 machine guns
  - 9x 45mm mortars (Brixia M35)
  - 6x 81mm mortars (Mod 35)

**Assessment:** The 91st Regiment was in severe condition by June 1942, operating at less than half strength with minimal motorization. The regiment's 128 horses indicate reliance on animal transport. The low officer count (34 vs. theoretical ~120) suggests significant attrition.

#### 92° Reggimento Fanteria 'Basilicata'
- **Strength:** 3,560 personnel (122 officers, 3,438 troops)
- **Status:** Under-strength but combat-capable
- **Equipment:**
  - 400 horses
  - 60 trucks (division's primary motor transport)
  - 11 motorcycles, 20 bicycles
  - 18x 47/32mm AT guns
  - 81 submachine guns
  - 36 machine guns
  - 27x 45mm mortars
  - 18x 81mm mortars

**Assessment:** The 92nd Regiment was the division's primary combat formation, absorbing the division's entire truck allocation. At ~75% strength, it was more effective than the 91st but still significantly depleted.

### Artillery Regiment

#### 5° Reggimento Artiglieria 'Superga'
**Organization:**
- **Field Artillery:** 3 battalions, each with 3 batteries of 75/18 Mod 34 howitzers (27 tubes total)
- **Anti-Aircraft:** 1 battalion with 3 batteries of 20/65 Mod 35 AA guns (9 tubes total)

**Capabilities:**
- **75/18 Howitzer:** 9,500m maximum range, pack-transportable for mountain warfare
- **20mm Breda AA:** Limited effectiveness vs. modern aircraft, dual-purpose (AA/ground)

**Assessment:** Standard Italian divisional artillery with adequate numbers but limited by ammunition shortages and the relatively short range of the 75/18. The AA battalion provided minimal air defense against RAF attacks.

### Support & Service Units
- **Medical:** 3 field hospitals (178th, 179th, 180th), 1 surgical unit, 1 dental unit, 1 radiological unit
- **Engineering:** 2nd Field Section
- **Supply:** 21st Supply Service, field bakery

## III. Equipment & Combat Power

### Infantry Weapons
| Weapon | Quantity | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Carcano M91/38 Rifle | ~3,800 | Standard Italian bolt-action rifle, 6.5mm |
| Beretta M38 SMG | 105 | Modern but insufficient quantities |
| Breda M30 LMG | 48 | 6.5mm, magazine-fed, limited firepower |
| 45mm Brixia Mortar | 36 | Short-range infantry support |
| 81mm Mortar Mod 35 | 24 | Effective indirect fire weapon |

### Anti-Tank Capability
- **Total AT Guns:** 22x 47/32 Mod 35
- **Penetration:** ~50mm @ 500m vs. 30° slope
- **Assessment:** Inadequate vs. British Crusader, Grant, and Valentine tanks. Could defeat light armor and armored cars only.

### Artillery
- **Field:** 27x 75/18 howitzers (9,500m range)
- **AA:** 9x 20mm Breda (effective ceiling 2,000m)
- **Effectiveness:** Adequate for defensive fire missions, limited counter-battery capability

### Vehicles & Mobility
| Type | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Trucks | 60 | All allocated to 92nd Regiment |
| Motorcycles | 13 | Liaison and reconnaissance |
| Horses | 528+ | Primary transport for 91st Regiment |
| Bicycles | 26 | Limited tactical use in desert |

**Mobility Assessment:** The division was essentially static. Only one regiment (92nd) had truck transport. The 91st Regiment was horse-mobile, unsuitable for desert maneuver warfare. No organic armor or reconnaissance vehicles.

## IV. Supply & Logistics (Critical Shortfalls)

### Supply Status: **STRAINED**

#### Fuel Situation
- **Reserves:** 4.5 days at current consumption
- **Constraint:** Mediterranean interdiction by Royal Navy and RAF
- **Impact:** Limited mobility for motorized elements

#### Ammunition
- **Reserves:** 7 days of combat ammunition
- **Priorities:** Artillery shells prioritized over small arms
- **Risk:** Insufficient for sustained offensive operations

#### Water (Critical in Desert)
- **Daily Allocation:** 4.2 liters/person
- **Requirement:** Minimum 5L/day for desert operations
- **Status:** Below medical minimum, heat casualties likely

#### Supply Lines
- **Route:** Tripoli → Benghazi → Tobruk → forward positions
- **Distance:** ~1,600km from Tripoli
- **Vulnerability:** RAF interdiction, partisan activity, limited trucks
- **Operational Radius:** 120km from supply depot

### Logistics Assessment
The Superga Division's supply situation in June 1942 was precarious. With only 60 trucks and extended supply lines subject to Allied air attack, the division could not support offensive operations. Water shortages (4.2L vs. 5L requirement) meant heat casualties would mount during summer. Fuel for 4.5 days meant the division had minimal operational flexibility.

## V. Tactical Doctrine & Employment

### Division Role
**Defensive infantry division** for line-holding and positional warfare.

### Tactical Capabilities
1. **Defensive Operations:** Primary role - hold prepared positions
2. **Limited Counter-Attacks:** Battalion-level only, no mobile reserves
3. **Delaying Actions:** Could conduct phased withdrawals
4. **Static Defense:** Well-suited for fortified positions

### Tactical Limitations
1. **No Offensive Capability:** Insufficient vehicles, AT weapons inadequate
2. **Vulnerable to Armor:** 47/32 AT guns ineffective vs. British tanks
3. **Immobile:** One regiment horse-drawn, unsuitable for desert warfare
4. **Water-Dependent:** Cannot operate beyond 2-3 days from water sources
5. **Air Vulnerability:** Minimal AA defense, no air support coordination

### Historical Employment (Q2 1942)
- **May 1942:** Defensive positions on Gazala Line
- **June 1942:** Supporting role in Tobruk assault (June 20-21)
- **Losses:** Significant casualties during Gazala battles
- **Effectiveness:** Below average due to under-strength status and equipment shortages

---

## VI. Environmental & Operational Context

### Quarter: 1942-Q2 (April-June 1942)

#### Climate Conditions
- **Temperature:** 18-38°C (64-100°F)
- **Daylight:** 13.8 hours average
- **Storm Frequency:** 3 sandstorm days/month
- **Terrain:** Coastal plain and rocky desert

#### Environmental Impacts
1. **Heat Stress:** Temperatures exceeding 35°C degraded combat effectiveness
2. **Water Crisis:** 4.2L daily ration insufficient for sustained operations
3. **Sandstorms:** Disrupted supply convoys, reduced visibility
4. **Dust:** Weapon maintenance problems, vehicle breakdowns increased

### Strategic Situation (June 1942)

- **AT Capability:** ~30% (47/32 vs. 50mm/88mm)
- **Artillery:** ~60% (fewer tubes, shorter range)

### vs. British 8th Army Divisions
- **Firepower:** ~50% of British infantry division
- **Mobility:** ~30% (British divisions fully motorized)
- **AT Capability:** ~40% (British 2-pdr and 6-pdr superior)
- **Artillery:** ~70% (British 25-pdr longer range, more plentiful)

### vs. Other Italian Divisions (June 1942)
- **Better than:** Pavia, Bologna (more depleted)
- **Comparable to:** Brescia, Trento (similar strength/equipment)
- **Worse than:** Ariete Armored, Trieste Motorized (mobile divisions)

---

## IX. Lessons Learned & Historical Significance

### Critical Deficiencies
1. **Chronic Under-Strength:** 4,648 vs. 10,400 establishment (~45%)
2. **Mobility Crisis:** Only 60 trucks for entire division
3. **AT Gun Obsolescence:** 47/32 ineffective vs. British armor
4. **Water Shortages:** Below minimum for desert operations
5. **Supply Line Vulnerability:** 1,600km from Tripoli, constant air attack

### What Went Wrong
The Superga Division exemplifies the chronic problems of Italian forces in North Africa:
- **Industrial Weakness:** Italy could not produce sufficient trucks, tanks, or modern weapons
- **Naval Defeat:** Mediterranean losses strangled supply to North Africa
- **Strategic Overstretch:** Italy committed to multiple theaters (Russia, Balkans, Africa)
- **Tactical Doctrine:** Infantry divisions ill-suited for mobile desert warfare
- **Allied Air Superiority:** RAF interdiction devastated supply convoys

### Historical Outcome
The Superga Division continued to deteriorate through summer 1942. By the First Battle of El Alamein (July 1-27), the division was in poor condition. During the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 23 - November 4, 1942), the division was largely destroyed. Remnants surrendered in Tunisia in May 1943.
