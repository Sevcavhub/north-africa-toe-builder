## Historical Context

### Formation & Tunisia Campaign

The 1st Free French Division was officially formed on February 1, 1943, by consolidating Free French forces that had fought in the Middle East and North Africa since 1940-41. Under Général de Division Edgard de Larminat, the division participated in the final Tunisia Campaign (March-May 1943).

The division's finest hour came at the **Battle of Takrouna (April 19-20, 1943)**, where the 1st Free French Brigade under Pierre Koenig assaulted and captured a strategic height defended by Italian and German forces. This action opened the way for the final Allied offensive in Tunisia, culminating in Axis surrender in May 1943.

### Command Transition

Following the Tunisia victory, Edgard de Larminat was promoted to corps command, and **Général de Division Diego Brosset** assumed command of the division in mid-May 1943. Brosset, who had commanded the 1st Brigade during Tunisia, was a natural choice - a veteran of the Free French movement since 1940 and a proven combat leader.

### Rest and Refit Period (1943-Q2)

During May-June 1943 (1943-Q2), the division rested and refitted in Tripolitania, Libya. This period saw:
- Replacement of Tunisia Campaign casualties
- Integration of new equipment and vehicles from British stocks
- Training of replacements and unit reorganization
- Preparation for the coming Italian campaign

### Equipment Modernization

While maintaining its British equipment base (25-pounders, Valentine tanks, British trucks), the division gradually phased out obsolescent French weapons. However, some French equipment remained in service, particularly the venerable 75mm mle 1897 and Hotchkiss machine guns.

### Reorganization as 1re DMI

On August 1, 1943 (just after 1943-Q2), the division was officially redesignated as the **1re Division Motorisée d'Infanterie (1st DMI)** following the reunion of French forces after the Allied liberation of North Africa and the integration of former Vichy French units into the Free French forces.

### Looking Forward

The division would go on to fight in:
- **Sicily (July 1943):** Participated in Operation Husky
- **Italy Campaign (1943-1944):** Fighting up the Italian peninsula
- **Southern France Invasion (August 1944):** Operation Dragoon
- **Liberation of France (1944):** Drive into southern and eastern France
- **Germany (1945):** Final operations

Diego Brosset would lead the division with distinction until his death in a vehicle accident in September 1944, shortly after the liberation of Lyon.

## Additional Notes

1. The 1st Free French Division represents the culmination of Free French military development from 1940-1943, combining units that had fought across Africa and the Middle East.

2. The division's multi-ethnic composition (French, Foreign Legion, North African, Pacific Islander, Senegalese) made it unique among Allied formations.

3. The Battle of Takrouna (April 1943) established the division's combat reputation and became a symbol of Free French military prowess.

4. Diego Brosset's command (May 1943-September 1944) represented a high point in Free French military achievement before his tragic death in an accident.

5. The division's organization on the British brigade model (three brigades instead of traditional French two-regiment structure) reflected Free French adaptation to British Commonwealth military practices.

6. Equipment remained primarily British throughout 1943, with gradual phase-out of French legacy weapons as replacement British equipment became available.

7. The rest and refit period in Libya (May-June 1943) was essential for integrating replacements and preparing for the demanding Italian campaign.

8. The division would be redesignated 1re Division Motorisée d'Infanterie (1st DMI) on August 1, 1943, reflecting the reunion of Free French and former Vichy forces under a unified French command structure.
