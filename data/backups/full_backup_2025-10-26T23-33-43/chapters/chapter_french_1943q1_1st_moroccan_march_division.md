## Supply & Logistics (Schema v3.0.0+)

**Fuel Available:** 6 days  
**Ammunition Available:** 7 days  
**Water:** 7 liters per man per day  
**Food Available:** 8 days  

**Supply Line Status:** Stretched - Supply lines run from Algerian bases through British 1st Army logistics network. Severe spare parts shortages for pre-war French equipment.

**Resupply Interval:** Every 5 days  
**Operational Radius:** 80 km  
**Fuel Consumption:** 12,000 liters per day  

**Critical Shortages:**
- Spare parts for French vehicles
- Anti-tank ammunition
- Modern anti-tank weapons

**Logistics Note:** Division entirely dependent on Allied logistics infrastructure. American re-equipment beginning late Q1 1943 will significantly improve sustainability.

## Weather & Environment (Schema v3.0.0+)

**Terrain:** Mountainous - Eastern Dorsal Mountains of central Tunisia with rocky passes and wadis

**Temperature Range:** 8-22°C (winter conditions January-March 1943)

**Seasonal Impact:** Winter rains create mud and flash floods in wadis. Cold nights in mountains require winter clothing. Weather conditions favor infantry defense over armor mobility.

**Environmental Challenges:**
- Mountain warfare conditions
- Flash flooding in wadis during winter rains
- Cold nights requiring winter clothing
- Rocky terrain limiting vehicle movement

**Tactical Advantages:** Mountainous terrain strongly favors defensive infantry operations. Moroccan troops highly experienced in mountain warfare from pre-war Atlas Mountains campaigns.

## Tactical Doctrine

**Primary Role:** Defensive infantry division holding sectors of the Eastern Dorsal Mountains in central Tunisia

**Special Capabilities:**
- North African troops well-adapted to desert conditions
- Experienced in colonial warfare tactics
- Strong esprit de corps among Moroccan tirailleurs units

**Known Issues:**
- Inadequate anti-tank capability versus 1943 German armor (Panzer IV, Tiger I)
- Limited mechanization compared to German and British forces
- Obsolete pre-war equipment with critical spare parts shortages
- Artillery effective but limited in range and mobility
- Poor coordination with Allied forces initially due to recent armistice

**Desert Adaptations:** Troops well-acclimated to North African terrain and climate. French colonial forces had extensive desert warfare experience from pre-war operations in Morocco and Algeria.
