## Supply Status

## Tactical Doctrine & Capabilities

**Primary Role:** Infantry division in XIII Corps southern sector at Second Battle of El Alamein. Mission: Support 7th Armoured Division operations, hold defensive positions, prevent Axis breakthrough from southern sector.

### Special Capabilities

- Fresh division with full strength and modern equipment
- Territorial Army units with strong regional cohesion (Home Counties)
- Well-trained in UK before North Africa deployment
- Modern 6-pounder anti-tank guns in good supply

### Tactical Innovations

- Operation Braganza (29-30 September) - night raid by 131st Brigade before main battle
- Adaptation to desert warfare during acclimatization period (June-September 1942)
- Integration with veteran 7th Armoured Division in XIII Corps

### Known Issues

- No organic armor (infantry division)
- First action in North Africa - limited desert warfare experience
- Arrived mid-1942 - only 4-5 months acclimatization before El Alamein
- Territorial Army division adjusting to professional regular army standards
- Climate adjustment challenges (UK to North African desert)

**Desert Adaptations:** Limited desert warfare experience. Division deployed to North Africa May 29, 1942. Underwent desert acclimatization and training June-September 1942. First combat action: Operation Braganza (Sep 29-30) and Second Battle of El Alamein (Oct 23). Still adapting to desert conditions in Q4 1942.

## Historical Context

## Wargaming Data

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|

| **Experience** | Green (first major battle) |

### Special Rules

- Fresh troops bonus (full strength, good morale)
- Regional cohesion (Home Counties Territorial units)
- Modern equipment (6-pounder AT guns)
- Desert inexperience penalty (first 6 months in theater)

### Scenario Suitability

- Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 11 November 1942) - XIII Corps southern sector
- Operation Braganza (29-30 September 1942) - night raid scenario
- Fresh division vs veteran opposition scenarios
- Territorial Army divisions in North Africa

### Historical Engagements

- Operation Braganza (29-30 September 1942) - night raid by 131st Brigade
- Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 11 November 1942) - XIII Corps southern sector support to 7th Armoured Division
- Pursuit to Tunisia (November-December 1942)

Commander: Major-General Ivor Hughes (from March 15, 1942)

Brigade composition: 131st (Queen's/Surrey), 132nd (Kent & Surrey), 133rd (Royal Sussex)

Territorial Army division from Home Counties (Sussex, Kent, Surrey)

Tier 2 classification due to estimated personnel/equipment and missing commander names

Personnel and equipment estimated from standard British infantry division establishment 1942

## Conclusion

The Italian XX Corpo d'Armata Motorizzato in Q2 1941 represents an important transitional phase in Italian North African operations. As an informal corps structure with only the 132nd Ariete Division attached and under German operational control, it illustrates the evolving nature of Axis mobile operations in the desert campaign. The formal establishment of the corps in Q3 1941 would bring additional divisions and a more robust command structure.
