### Data Sources

### Research Notes

- Q2 1942 critical quarter: XX Corps participation in Operation Theseus (Gazala offensive 26 May - 21 June)
- Tank strength 342 (2% increase from Q1 335 tanks) - minimal reinforcements, high attrition expected Gazala
- Semovente 75/18 increased to 24 guns (33% increase from Q1 18 guns) - best Italian armored vehicle
- CRITICAL WEAKNESS: M13/40 and M14/41 tanks no match for British Grant tanks arriving Egypt Q2 1942
- 47/32 AT guns inadequate vs British Grant tanks (51mm @ 60° armor = 102mm effective - cannot penetrate)
- Gazala offensive 26 May - 21 June 1942: XX Corps heavy tank losses at Knightsbridge (British destroyed ~100 Italian tanks 12-13 June)
- Bir Hakeim siege (27 May - 11 June): Trieste division heavy casualties vs Free French 1st Brigade heroic defense
- Historical significance: XX Corps proved Italian armor inadequate for modern desert warfare vs British Grant tanks

## Conclusion

**XX Corpo d'Armata Motocorazzato** represents a significant formation of the Italian forces in North Africa during 1942 Q2 (April-June). The unit's organization, equipment, and operational status reflect the challenges and evolution of desert warfare during this period.
