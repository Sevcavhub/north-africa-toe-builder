    "validation_notes": "US G2 July 1943 document confirms: '60th SABRATA Division (Infantry) - Home station: Caserta - History: Metropolitan division permanently stationed in Libya. Practically destroyed in 1940-41. Reformed and in 1942 advanced into Egypt.' Composition confirmed: 85th VERONA Inf Regt, 86th VERONA Inf Regt, 42d SABRATA Arty Regt. Commander Guido Della Bona confirmed from web search at 80% confidence (Tier 2). TM 30-420 provides standard Italian binary division structure: authorized strength ~12,169 personnel, 48 artillery pieces, 363 vehicles. Q2 1941 estimates based on 'practically destroyed' status requiring significant reduction from authorized strength. Tier 2 research (Military Wiki, TheReaderWiki, The Crusader Project, Warfare History Network) provided detailed operational history including Battle of Beda Fomm destruction (Feb 1941), coastal defense assignment at Al Khums (Feb-Apr), and redeployment to Gharyan-Nalut defensive sector (May-Aug) for rebuilding. Artillery Regiment 42º confirmed destroyed at Beda Fomm and replaced by Artillery Grouping 'Sabratha' with CCLXXXII and CCLXXXIV groups. Overall 78% confidence (increased from 72%) reflects solid source documentation of unit identity/composition plus enhanced operational history detail from Tier 2 research, though equipment/personnel numbers remain estimated due to understrength status.",
    "recommended_improvements": "If Italian archival sources become available (Comando Supremo records, 60ª Divisione war diary, personnel rosters), verify exact Q2 1941 strength, precise equipment holdings, detailed reconstitution timeline, complete command staff, and operational deployment. Niehorster's detailed Italian OOB data would provide more precise Q2 1941 snapshot if accessible. British intelligence assessments from Operation Compass aftermath might document Italian division losses and Q2 1941 status."
