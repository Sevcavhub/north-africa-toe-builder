-- RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCHEMA ENHANCEMENTS
-- ============================================================================

-- Future schema additions (not executed, just documented):
--
-- ALTER TABLE equipment ADD COLUMN lend_lease BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
-- ALTER TABLE equipment ADD COLUMN source_nation TEXT;
-- ALTER TABLE equipment ADD COLUMN operational_notes TEXT;
-- ALTER TABLE equipment ADD COLUMN deployment_theater TEXT;
-- ALTER TABLE equipment ADD COLUMN availability_start TEXT;
-- ALTER TABLE equipment ADD COLUMN availability_end TEXT;
--
-- These would enable better tracking of:
-- - Cross-nation equipment transfers
-- - Lend-lease vs indigenous production
-- - Theater-specific deployments
-- - Equipment availability windows
