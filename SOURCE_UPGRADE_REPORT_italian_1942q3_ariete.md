## Known Gaps Documentation (Enhanced)

The upgrade process has IMPROVED gap documentation by tying each gap to specific primary source limitations:

1. **Officer/NCO/Enlisted Breakdown**: Now tied to TM E 30-420 Section 106 standard divisional totals rather than generic estimates

2. **Commander Verification**: Arena CONFIRMED in G-2 document; subordinate commanders remain typical for period

3. **Vehicle Operational Percentages**: Now documented with specific historical context (First El Alamein attrition, Q3 1942 rebuild)

4. **Squad-Level Positions**: Explicitly noted as outside scope per TM E 30-420 organizational charts (division-level document)

5. **Support Vehicle Counts**: Now tied to TM E 30-420 Section 111 artillery regiment transport allocations
