---

## VALIDATION PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT

### Hybrid Source Validation Requirements
- ✅ Wikipedia for identification ONLY
- ❌ **FAILED**: Tier 1/2 sources REQUIRED for extraction (60% minimum)
- ❌ **FAILED**: Must have 3+ key facts from Tier 1/2

### Required Corroboration (from Tier 1/2)
1. ✅ **Unit designation confirmation**: "47th Bombardment Group (Light)" 
   - **Source**: WITW _airgroup.csv line 1855 (Tier 1)
   - **Evidence**: "47th USAAF LB Grp"
   
2. ❌ **FAILED - Aircraft Variant Specificity**: At least ONE specific aircraft variant (e.g., "A-20C-1" NOT just "A-20 Havoc")
   - **Found**: Generic "A-20", "A-20B", "A-20C" references
   - **Required**: "Douglas A-20C-1 Havoc" or "Douglas A-20B-2 Havoc" (with dash number)
   - **Gap**: NO Tier 1/2 sources provide variant-level detail (A-20C-1 vs A-20C-5)
   
3. ✅ **Operational dates**: October-November 1942 deployment, December 1942 combat start
   - **Sources**: Multiple web sources (History of War, Wikipedia, American Air Museum)
   - **Note**: First combat mission 13 December 1942 is OUTSIDE 1942-Q4

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE: WRONG QUARTER

### Unit Status During 1942-Q4
- **October 1942**: Unit in transit from USA to North Africa
- **November 18, 1942**: Arrived at Mediouna, French Morocco (assembly/training)
- **December 1-13, 1942**: Pre-combat preparation, no combat operations
- **December 13, 1942**: First combat mission (OUTSIDE 1942-Q4)

### Conclusion
**47th Bombardment Group was NOT combat operational during 1942-Q4**. The unit was:
- In transit (October)
- Assembling at Mediouna (November)
- Pre-combat preparation (early December)

**First combat**: December 13, 1942 = **1942-Q4 ends December 31, 1942, but unit was not combat operational until Q4's last 2.5 weeks, with minimal operations**

**Correct extraction quarter**: **1943-Q1** (January-March 1943) when unit was fully operational from Youks-les-Bains

## WHAT IS NEEDED (Tier 1/2 Sources Required)

### Critical Gaps

**1. Aircraft Variant Specificity (BLOCKER):**
- Need: "Douglas A-20C-1 Havoc" or "Douglas A-20B-2 Havoc"
- Have: Generic "A-20", "A-20B", "A-20C"
- **Schema requirement**: `"designation": "Douglas A-20C-1 Havoc"` (with dash number)
- **Source type needed**: USAAF unit histories, official reports, squadron histories

**2. Aircraft Strength Data:**
- Total aircraft on strength
- Operational vs damaged vs reserve breakdown
- Variant-specific counts
- **Source type needed**: USAAF monthly status reports, unit returns

**3. Personnel Numbers:**
- Total personnel
- Pilots count
- Ground crew, mechanics, armorers, signals
- **Source type needed**: USAAF unit rosters, organizational returns

**4. Operational Data (for correct quarter):**
- Sorties flown
- Bomb tonnage
- Losses
- Claims
- **Source type needed**: USAAF combat mission reports

**5. Supply Status:**
- Fuel reserves
- Ammunition stocks
- Ordnance counts
- **Source type needed**: USAAF logistics reports

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### 1. Extract Correct Quarter
**DO NOT extract 1942-Q4** - Unit was not combat operational  
**EXTRACT 1943-Q1 instead** (January-March 1943):
- Unit operational from Youks-les-Bains
- Full combat operations in Tunisia Campaign
- Better source availability for active combat period

### 2. Locate Tier 1/2 Sources

**Priority 1: USAAF Official Histories**
- Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) microfilm records
- 47th Bombardment Group unit history (official USAAF document)
- Twelfth Air Force historical reports (November 1942 - May 1943)

**Priority 2: Squadron Histories**
- 84th, 85th, 86th, 97th Bombardment Squadron official histories
- Squadron diary/war diary entries

**Priority 3: USAAF Statistical Digests**
- USAAF Statistical Digest World War II (official publication)
- Table 159: USAAF unit strengths by month and theater
- Aircraft inventory reports for Twelfth Air Force

**Priority 4: Combat Narratives**
- USAAF official combat narratives for North African operations
- "The Army Air Forces in World War II" (official multi-volume history)

### 3. Alternative Data Sources

**National Archives:**
- Record Group 18: Records of the Army Air Forces
- Record Group 342: Records of United States Air Force Commands
- Unit historical reports (monthly/quarterly)

**Published Sources:**
- Christopher Shores: "Fighters Over Tunisia"
- Kit Carter & Robert Mueller: "Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces"
- Wesley Frank Craven & James Lea Cate: "The Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume Two: Europe - TORCH to POINTBLANK"

## EXTRACTION DECISION

**STATUS**: ❌ **EXTRACTION REFUSED**

**Reasons:**
1. ❌ Aircraft variant specificity requirement NOT met (only generic A-20, need A-20C-1 etc.)
2. ❌ Insufficient Tier 1/2 corroboration (1 of 3 required key facts)
3. ❌ WRONG QUARTER - Unit not combat operational in 1942-Q4
4. ❌ No personnel data from Tier 1/2 sources
5. ❌ No aircraft strength data from Tier 1/2 sources

**Minimum requirement**: 60% data completeness from Tier 1/2 sources  
**Actual achievement**: ~30% (only unit designation confirmed from Tier 1)

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Correct the extraction request**:
   - Change quarter from 1942-Q4 to **1943-Q1**
   - Unit was combat operational January-March 1943

2. **Locate Tier 1 sources**:
   - USAAF official unit histories
   - Air Force Historical Research Agency records
   - USAAF Statistical Digest WW2

3. **Find variant-specific data**:
   - Squadron equipment records
   - Aircraft serial number assignments
   - Maintenance logs (if available)

4. **Alternative approach**:
   - Use WITW game data as Tier 1 baseline
   - Supplement with Tier 2 web sources (Asisbiz, etc.)
   - Accept lower confidence tier (60-74% = "review_recommended")

## VALIDATION PROTOCOL VERDICT

**Hybrid Source Validation Protocol**: ❌ FAILED

**Requirements:**
- Tier 1/2 sources REQUIRED for extraction (60% minimum): ❌ NOT MET (~30%)
- Must have 3+ key facts from Tier 1/2: ❌ NOT MET (1 of 3)
- Aircraft variant specificity: ❌ NOT MET (no dash numbers)

**Conclusion:**
**Cannot proceed with extraction until Tier 1/2 sources located and aircraft variant specificity achieved.**

**Recommended path forward**:
1. Change quarter to 1943-Q1 (correct operational period)
2. Locate USAAF official unit histories
3. Find squadron equipment records for variant detail
4. Return when 60%+ Tier 1/2 corroboration achieved
