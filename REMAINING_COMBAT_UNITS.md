## üìä Aggregate Units (Extract After Combat Units)

**Note**: 34 aggregate units (corps and armies) will be extracted AFTER all combat divisions are complete per bottom-up aggregation policy.

- **Corps**: 22 units (1942-Q3 through 1943-Q2)
- **Armies**: 12 units (1942-Q1 through 1943-Q2)

These aggregates roll up data from their subordinate divisions and should only be extracted once all division data is available.

## üîß Post-Extraction Tasks

After these 3 divisions are complete:

1. ‚úÖ Run checkpoint to verify all 3 units
2. ‚úÖ Progress will be 375/411 (91.2%)
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Begin aggregate extraction (34 corps/armies)
4. üéØ Phase 6 complete when all 411 units done

## üìù Verification

- ‚úÖ Verified against seed file: `projects/north_africa_seed_units_COMPLETE.json`
- ‚úÖ Cross-checked with WORKFLOW_STATE.json (372 completed)
- ‚úÖ Remaining count matches: 411 total - 372 complete = 39 pending
  - 3 combat divisions
  - 34 aggregates (corps/armies)
  - 2 possible duplicates (needs investigation)
