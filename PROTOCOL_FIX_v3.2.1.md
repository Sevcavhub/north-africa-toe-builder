# Exhaustive Search Protocol v3.2.1 - Critical Fixes

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Issue**: Agent violated exhaustive search protocol in autonomous session
**Status**: URGENT FIX REQUIRED

---

## Problem Identified

During autonomous session for 1941-Q2 batch:

**What Happened**:
1. Agent checked Tier 1 sources (British Army Lists)
2. Agent marked Tier 2 sources as **"PENDING"** instead of checking them
3. Agent concluded "unit doesn't exist" without completing exhaustive search
4. Agent paused prematurely

**What SHOULD Have Happened**:
1. ‚úÖ Check ALL Tier 1 sources
2. ‚úÖ **ACTUALLY CHECK** ALL Tier 2 sources (not mark as "PENDING")
3. ‚úÖ Check Tier 3 if critical gaps remain
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Only then pause with exhaustive_search_report

**User Feedback**:
- "Seed is saying they did, Seed overrides agents"
- User found valid Tier 2 source (https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk XIII Corps history PDF)
- Agent should have found this source during Tier 2 check

---

## Critical Rules to Add

### 1. SEED DATA IS AUTHORITATIVE

**NEW RULE (v3.2.1)**:
```
üö® SEED DATA OVERRIDE üö®

If the project seed data says a unit exists in a quarter, it EXISTS.
Your job is to FIND the data, not question unit existence.

SEED OVERRIDES ALL AGENT CONCLUSIONS.

Never conclude "unit doesn't exist" unless:
1. You've checked ALL Tier 1 sources
2. You've checked ALL Tier 2 sources
3. You've checked Tier 3 specialized archives
4. User explicitly confirms unit truly doesn't exist
```

### 2. NO "PENDING" STATUS ALLOWED

**NEW RULE (v3.2.1)**:
```
‚ùå NEVER mark sources as "PENDING" or "NOT CHECKED"
‚úÖ ALWAYS actually CHECK the source and report result

Status must be one of:
- CHECKED - Source was accessed and searched
- NOT_FOUND - Source doesn't exist or unavailable
- ACCESS_DENIED - Source requires credentials/payment

"PENDING" is not a valid status.
```

### 3. TIER 2 IS MANDATORY

**NEW RULE (v3.2.1)**:
```
Tier 2 curated web sources are NOT optional.

Before pausing with "data not found", you MUST:
1. ‚úÖ Check ALL Tier 2 sources from exhaustive_search_catalog.json
2. ‚úÖ Document what each source contained or didn't contain
3. ‚úÖ Report actual findings, not "would need to check"

Examples of INCORRECT Tier 2 reporting:
‚ùå "source": "Niehorster OOB", "status": "PENDING", "result": "Web access required"
‚ùå "source": "British Military History", "status": "PENDING", "result": "Would need to check"

Examples of CORRECT Tier 2 reporting:
‚úÖ "source": "Niehorster OOB", "status": "CHECKED", "result": "XIII Corps shown for Sep 1941, no Q2 entry"
‚úÖ "source": "British Military History", "status": "CHECKED", "result": "XIII Corps history PDF found - Q2 1941 commander and units documented"
```

## Agent Catalog Updates Required

**File**: `agents/agent_catalog.json`
**Agent**: `historical_research`
**Version**: v3.2.0 ‚Üí v3.2.1

**Changes**:

1. Add seed authority notice at top of EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH MANDATE:
   ```
   **SEED DATA IS AUTHORITATIVE**: If the seed data says a unit exists in a quarter, it EXISTS. Your job is to FIND the data, not question unit existence. Seed overrides all agent conclusions.
   ```

2. Add "NO PENDING" rule:
   ```
   **NEVER mark sources as "PENDING"**: ALL Tier 2 sources must be CHECKED before pausing. "PENDING" is not a valid status.
   ```

3. Update validation rules:
   ```
   "CRITICAL: Tier 2 sources marked 'PENDING' will REJECT output",
   "CRITICAL: Before concluding unit doesn't exist, ALL Tier 2 sources must show status 'CHECKED'",
   "CRITICAL: Seed data is ground truth - never contradict seed unit existence"
   ```

## Immediate Actions

### For XIII Corps (RESOLVED)

‚úÖ **Status**: Resumed with user-provided source
‚úÖ **Source**: https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2020/09/XIII-Corps-History-Personnel-V2_1.pdf
‚úÖ **Guidance**: Seed data is authoritative - extract using British Military History PDF

### For XXX Corps (PENDING)

**Recommendation**: Same as XIII Corps
- Seed says XXX Corps exists Q2 1941
- Agent should check Tier 2 sources (British Military History, Niehorster, Long Long Trail)
- User can provide guidance to extract using same sources as XIII Corps

### For Italian XX Mobile Corps (PENDING)

**Recommendation**: Check Tier 2 Italian sources
- Comando Supremo
- Regio Esercito online
- Niehorster Italian OOB
- Contemporary Italian military records

---

## Testing Protocol

Before next autonomous session:

1. ‚úÖ Update agent_catalog.json with v3.2.1 rules
2. ‚úÖ Test with XIII Corps extraction
3. ‚úÖ Verify agent actually CHECKS Tier 2 sources (not marks as PENDING)
4. ‚úÖ Verify seed authority is respected

---

## Implementation Priority

**URGENT** - This fix is required before next autonomous session to prevent:
- Premature pauses
- Incorrect "unit doesn't exist" conclusions
- Violation of exhaustive search mandate
- User frustration from agent not checking available sources

---

**Version**: v3.2.1 (pending implementation)
**Status**: DRAFT - Awaiting agent_catalog.json update
**Related**: VERSION_HISTORY.md should be updated with v3.2.1 entry after implementation
