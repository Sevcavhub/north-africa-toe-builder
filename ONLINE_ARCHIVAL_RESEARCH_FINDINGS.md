## Priority Quarters to Fill

Based on ground forces coverage and data availability:

### High Priority (Ground forces units exist)

| Quarter | Nation | Data Found | Quality | Integration Ready |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1941-Q4 | British | ✅ Yes (1,000 aircraft, 27 sq) | Good | Yes - matches 8th Army formation |
| 1942-Q4 | British | ✅ Yes (1,500 aircraft, 96 sq) | Good | Check if 8th Army JSON exists |
| 1943-Q1 | German | ✅ Yes (150 aircraft) | Fair | Check if Panzerarmee JSON exists |

### Medium Priority (Partial data, estimates needed)

| Quarter | Nation | Data Found | Quality | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|-------|
| 1941-Q1 | Italian | ✅ Yes (155 aircraft, 7 gruppi) | Good | March data, use for Q1 |
| 1942-Q3 | Italian | ⚠️ Estimated (~350) | Fair | Interpolate from Q2/Q4 |
| 1940-Q2 | British | ✅ Yes (300 aircraft, 29 sq) | Fair | ME Command total, not just WDF |

### Low Priority (Sparse data, requires archival research)

| Quarter | Nation | Data Found | Quality | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|-------|
| 1940-Q3, Q4 | All | ❌ Limited | Poor | Early war period, limited operations |
| 1941-Q3 | All | ❌ Limited | Poor | Between Crusader prep periods |
| 1943-Q1 | British, Italian | ⚠️ Partial | Fair | Post-Tunisia, some data |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Quick Expansion (2-3 hours)

Use found data to generate 3-5 new quarterly summaries:

1. **british_1941q4_air_summary.json** - 1,000 aircraft, 27 squadrons (Good data)
2. **british_1942q4_air_summary.json** - 1,500 aircraft, 96 squadrons (Good data)
3. **italian_1941q1_air_summary.json** - 155 aircraft, 7 gruppi (Good data)
4. **german_1943q1_air_summary.json** - 150 aircraft (Fair data)
5. **UPGRADE german_1942q2_air_summary.json** - 542 aircraft (upgrade from 20)

**Method**: Same hybrid approach (found aggregates + estimates)
**Result**: 12 total summaries (vs current 7), 71% more coverage

### Option 2: Archival Deep Dive (10-15 hours + £50-100)

Access UK National Archives AIR 27 for squadron-level detail:

1. Purchase access to key squadron ORBs for 1941-1942
2. Extract monthly strength returns from Form 540/541
3. Upgrade all British summaries to Tier 1 (90%+)
4. Fill additional quarters with primary source data

**Method**: Direct archival extraction
**Result**: Tier 1 quality for all British quarters, 15-20 summaries

### Option 3: Systematic AFHRA Search (5-8 hours, free)

Search AFHRA digital collections methodically:

1. Search for "Desert Air Force" strength returns
2. Search for "Fliegerführer Afrika" intelligence reports
3. Search for "Regia Aeronautica" assessments
4. Request promising documents via email

**Method**: Free archival research
**Result**: May find Tier 1 sources for Axis forces

## Decision Needed

Which approach should we take?

**Quick Expansion (Option 1)** → Immediate results, 71% more coverage
**Archival Deep Dive (Option 2)** → Best quality, requires budget
**AFHRA Search (Option 3)** → Free, time-intensive, uncertain yield

**Hybrid Recommendation**:
1. Do Option 1 NOW (2-3 hours, immediate value)
2. Then Option 3 (background research, no cost)
3. Consider Option 2 if budget becomes available
