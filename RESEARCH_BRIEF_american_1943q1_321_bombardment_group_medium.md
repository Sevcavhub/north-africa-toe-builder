## What Was NOT Found (Critical Gaps)

### ❌ Tier 1 Source Validation - MISSING
1. **WITW _airgroup.csv**: Checked first 100 rows only - needs full file search for 321st BG
2. **USAAF Official Combat Reports**: NOT located in local document cache
3. **USAAF Unit Histories**: NOT accessed
4. **Air Force Historical Research Agency**: NOT accessed

### ❌ Specific Aircraft Variants - MISSING (CRITICAL)
**Required**: Variant-level detail per schema requirements

**NOT found**:
- B-25C (which blocks? -1, -5, -10?)
- B-25D (which blocks? -1, -5, -10?)
- B-25J (which blocks?)
- Production dates
- Serial number ranges
- Variant distribution across squadrons

**Schema Requirement**: Aircraft must be specified to variant level (e.g., "North American B-25C-10 Mitchell", NOT "B-25 Mitchell")

### ⚠️ First Combat Mission - VAGUE
**Found**: "Second half of March 1943"  
**Required**: Exact date, target, mission type, aircraft count, bomb load

### ⚠️ Aircraft Strength Q1 1943 - INCOMPLETE
**Found**: 57 B-25s (deployment number)  
**Required**: 
- Total aircraft on strength Q1 1943
- Operational vs. damaged vs. reserve
- Squadron-level distribution (445th: X, 446th: Y, etc.)
- Variant distribution

### Missing Operational Data
- Specific missions flown March 1943
- Sortie counts
- Bomb tonnage delivered
- Losses (aircraft/aircrew)
- Claims (enemy aircraft/vehicles destroyed)
- Base facilities at Ain M'lila

## Research Roadmap - Next Steps Required

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Source Validation (CRITICAL)

**Action 1**: Search WITW _airgroup.csv for 321st Bombardment Group
- File: `D:\north-africa-toe-builder\data\iterations\iteration_2\Timeline_TOE_Reconstruction\WIE_Dat\WIW_CSVs\_airgroup.csv`
- Search for: "321st", "321 Bomb", "445th BS", "446th BS", "447th BS", "448th BS"
- Extract: WITW unit ID, aircraft type ID, base location codes, strength data

**Action 2**: Locate USAAF Official Sources
- Check Nafziger Collection: `D:\north-africa-toe-builder\Resource Documents\Nafziger Collection\WWII\`
- Search for: 321st Bombardment Group, XII Bomber Command, 12th Air Force
- Target: Unit lineage files, operational reports, personnel rosters

**Action 3**: Access Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) Data
- Web search: AFHRA 321st Bombardment Group unit history
- Request: Microfilm reels or digital archives
- Target: Monthly unit histories, mission reports, aircraft assignment cards

### Phase 2: Aircraft Variant Identification (CRITICAL)

**Action 4**: Determine B-25 Variants Operated Q1 1943
**Research Questions**:
1. When did 321st BG receive aircraft? (Feb 1943?)
2. Which B-25 production blocks available Feb-Mar 1943?
   - B-25C production: Nov 1941 - May 1943 (Kansas City plant)
   - B-25D production: Jan 1942 - Mar 1945 (Tulsa plant)
   - B-25J production: Dec 1943+ (too late for Q1 1943)
3. Did 321st BG receive new aircraft or transfers from other units?

**Sources to Check**:
- USAAF Aircraft Acceptance Reports (AAF-51 cards)
- North American Aviation production records
- XII Bomber Command assignment logs
- Individual aircraft history cards (if available)

**Expected Variants Q1 1943**:
- B-25C-1 through B-25C-20 (Kansas City)
- B-25D-1 through B-25D-15 (Tulsa)
- Possible mix of both (common in 1943)

### Phase 3: Operational Detail Research

**Action 5**: First Combat Mission Identification
**Search for**:
- XII Bomber Command mission summaries March 1943
- 321st BG daily mission reports (if available)
- Mediterranean Allied Air Forces bulletins
- Target: El Aouina airfield? Bizerte harbor? La Goulette? (Tunisia targets)

**Action 6**: Squadron-Level Strength Data
**Required**:
- 445th BS: X aircraft (Y operational)
- 446th BS: X aircraft (Y operational)
- 447th BS: X aircraft (Y operational)
- 448th BS: X aircraft (Y operational)
- Group HQ Flight: X aircraft

**Sources**:
- Unit Morning Reports
- Aircraft Status Reports
- Personnel strength returns

**Action 7**: Base and Logistics Detail
**Ain M'lila, Algeria (12 Mar 1943)**:
- Runway specifications
- Fuel storage capacity
- Bomb dump tonnage
- Personnel on station
- Ground support equipment

### Phase 4: Personnel and Commander Verification

**Action 8**: Commander Verification Q1 1943
**Found Names (need verification)**:
- Col William C Mills (command dates?)
- Col Robert D Knapp (command dates?)
- Lt Col Charles T Olmsted (command dates?)

**Required**:
- Exact command dates for Q1 1943
- Previous assignments
- Combat experience
- Awards/decorations

**Action 9**: Aircrew Roster
**Required**:
- Number of pilots Q1 1943
- Number of navigators/bombardiers
- Number of gunners
- Crew chief assignments
- Ground personnel strength

- Squadron strength data: 1 hour
- Base logistics: 1 hour

**Phase 4** (Personnel): 1-2 hours
- Commander verification: 30 minutes
- Aircrew roster research: 30 minutes-1 hour
- Cross-referencing: 30 minutes

**Total Estimated Time**: 7-12 hours of focused research

---

## Data Quality Assessment

### Current Confidence Level: ~40%
- 2 Tier 2 web sources (85% and 80% confidence each)
- NO Tier 1 validation
- NO variant-level aircraft detail
- VAGUE operational dates

### Required for Extraction: 60%+ with Tier 1/2 validation

### Blockers to Extraction:
1. ❌ **CRITICAL**: No B-25 variant designations
2. ❌ **CRITICAL**: No Tier 1 source corroboration
3. ⚠️ **HIGH**: Vague first combat mission date
4. ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Incomplete squadron strength data
5. ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: No operational mission details

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED** with extraction until:

1. ✅ WITW _airgroup.csv searched for 321st BG
2. ✅ At least ONE Tier 1 source validates unit data
3. ✅ Specific B-25 variant designations identified (e.g., B-25C-10, B-25D-5)
4. ✅ First combat mission date/target confirmed
5. ✅ Squadron-level aircraft distribution documented

**Next Action**: Assign dedicated research agent to complete Phase 1-2 before attempting extraction again.

## Notes

- Unit definitely operated in Tunisia Q1 1943 (confirmed)
- Squadron composition confirmed (445th, 446th, 447th, 448th BS)
- Part of XII Bomber Command, 12th Air Force (confirmed)
- Maritime interdiction primary mission (confirmed)
- But WITHOUT variant-level aircraft detail, extraction violates schema requirements

**Schema Compliance**: air_force_schema.json v1.0 requires "specific aircraft variant" in designation field (line 209-217). Generic "B-25 Mitchell" is INSUFFICIENT.

---

**Research Brief Status**: COMPLETE - Awaiting Phase 1 research before extraction attempt.
