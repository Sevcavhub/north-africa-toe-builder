### Requirement NOT Met ❌

**SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT VARIANTS INSUFFICIENT**

Schema requires variant-level specificity:
- ✅ ACCEPTABLE: "Martin B-26B-10-MA Marauder"
- ❌ UNACCEPTABLE: "B-26 Marauder" or "B-26B"

**What I Found**:
- General confirmation: Group operated Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers
- Production blocks mentioned: "B-26B and B-26C operated in North Africa late 1942"
- ONE specific example: Serial 41-18278 (B-26B-10-MA, 439th BS) - but lost Feb 1944
- Serial number range: Some aircraft in 41-17xxx and 41-18xxx range

**What I Could NOT Find**:
- Systematic documentation of which B-26 variants the 319th had in Q4 1942
- Aircraft inventory by variant for November-December 1942
- Distribution of B-26A vs B-26B vs B-26C across the four squadrons
- Specific production block assignments (B-26B-1, B-26B-2, B-26B-10, etc.)

**Evidence Quality**:
- Historical sources confirm "B-26 Marauder" generically
- Asisbiz.com has individual aircraft records but sparse coverage
- Joe Baugher's serial number database (primary Tier 2 source) was inaccessible
- No access to USAAF unit history files from Air Force Historical Research Agency

---

## TIER 1/2 SOURCE ASSESSMENT

### Tier 1 Sources CONSULTED:
- Army Air Corps Museum (319th BG unit history)
- Historical references to USAAF combat reports (via secondary sources)
- References to Air Force Historical Research Agency documents (not directly accessed)

### Tier 2 Sources CONSULTED:
- Asisbiz.com (partial aircraft coverage, confirmed 41-18278 B-26B-10-MA)
- B26.com (historical unit information)
- HistoryofWar.org (operational chronology)
- 319bg.org Honor Roll Project (squadron rosters)
- Joe Baugher serial number database (INACCESSIBLE - DNS error)

### Tier 1/2 Corroboration Score:
**3/3 Required Facts** ✅
- Unit designation ✅
- Combat operations/dates ✅
- Aircraft type ✅ (but lacking variant granularity)

However: **VARIANT SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENT = FAILED** ❌

## DATA AVAILABLE FOR EXTRACTION

If variant data becomes available, the following can be extracted immediately:

### Unit Structure
- **Designation**: 319th Bombardment Group (Medium)
- **Parent Formation**: XII Bomber Command, 12th Air Force
- **Squadrons**: 437th, 438th, 439th, 440th BS
- **Unit Type**: `bomber_group`

### Personnel (Estimates Based on Standard B-26 Group TO&E)
- **Pilots/Aircrew**: ~80-100 (4 squadrons, ~20-25 crews each)
- **Ground Crew**: ~400-500 (maintenance, ordnance, support)
- **Total**: ~500-600

Note: Historical sources mention only 17 aircraft operational upon arrival (of 57 that departed US), suggesting reduced personnel strength in Q4 1942.

### Base Progression (Q4 1942)
- **October 12, 1942**: Shipdham, England (staging)
- **November 11, 1942**: St-Leu, Algeria (first NA base)
- **November 18, 1942**: Tafaraoui, Algeria
- **November 24, 1942**: Maison Blanche, Algeria
- **December 12, 1942**: Telergma, Algeria (primary Q4 base)

### Commander
- **November 27 - December 4, 1942**: Lt Colonel Sam W Agee Jr
- **December 5, 1942 - January 10, 1943**: Major Joseph A Cunningham

### Combat Operations (Q4 1942)
1. **November 28, 1942**: Sfax, Tunisia - Harbor attack (first combat mission)
2. **November 30, 1942**: Gabes airfield - 1 aircraft lost
3. **December 4, 1942**: Mission over Tunisia - Group CO aircraft downed
4. **December 14, 1942**: Sousse harbor - Low-level attack
5. **December 15, 1942**: Mission over Tunisia - 12th BC CO KIA
6. **Ongoing**: Attacks on airdromes, harbors, rail facilities, shipping

### Supply Status
- **Fuel Reserves**: STRAINED (only 13 aircraft operational between 310th and 319th BG)
- **Operational Status**: CRITICAL (17 of 57 aircraft arrived; maximum 13 operational)
- **Attrition**: HIGH (multiple command losses in first month)

### Aircraft Status (Generic - NEEDS VARIANT DATA)
- **Type**: Martin B-26 Marauder
- **Total on Hand**: ~17-25 (estimates vary by source and date)
- **Operational**: ~6-13 (shared max with 310th BG)
- **Status**: Severe operational tempo, high losses, limited maintenance

**VARIANT BREAKDOWN NEEDED**:
- Likely mix of B-26A, B-26B (early blocks), possibly B-26C
- Serial numbers in 41-17xxx and 41-18xxx ranges suggest 1942 production
- REQUIRES: Unit equipment cards, USAAF TO&E documents, or comprehensive serial number tracking

## RECOMMENDED RESEARCH ACTIONS

To complete extraction, obtain:

### Priority 1: Aircraft Variant Data
1. **Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA)**
   - Request 319th BG Unit History files (June-December 1942)
   - Look for: Monthly strength reports, equipment status reports
   - Document codes: GP-319-HI, GP-319-SU

2. **Joe Baugher Serial Number Database**
   - Access: http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b26_19.html
   - Alternative: https://www.crouze.com/baugher/
   - Search: Serial numbers 41-17000 through 41-19000 (1942 B-26 production)
   - Filter: 319th BG, 437th/438th/439th/440th BS assignments

3. **National Archives (NARA)**
   - Record Group 18: Army Air Forces
   - Unit histories: 319th Bombardment Group
   - Monthly status reports: November-December 1942
   - Form 5: Individual Aircraft Record Cards

4. **B-26 Marauder Historical Society**
   - Archives: Unit rosters with aircraft assignments
   - Contact: B-26 researchers specializing in MTO operations

### Priority 2: Personnel Counts
- AFHRA unit strength reports (actual vs authorized)
- Squadron rosters by date
- Casualty reports (to estimate operational crew strength)

### Priority 3: Ordnance Data
- XII Bomber Command supply reports
- 319th BG ammunition expenditure reports
- Bomb loads by mission (from mission reports)

## EXTRACTION DECISION

**STATUS**: ❌ **EXTRACTION REFUSED**

**REASON**: Hybrid Source Validation Protocol requires specific aircraft variants, not generic "B-26 Marauder". While I have strong Tier 1/2 confirmation of unit designation, operations, and combat participation (3/3 required facts), the schema's mandatory `aircraft.variants.designation` field requires variant-level precision that available sources did not provide.

**CONFIDENCE IN AVAILABLE DATA**: 85%
- Unit structure, operations, dates: 95% confidence
- Personnel estimates: 70% confidence (based on standard TO&E, not actual reports)
- Aircraft variants: 30% confidence (one confirmed example, no systematic data)

**TIER PROJECTION**: If extracted with current data → **Tier 3** (partial_needs_research) due to generic aircraft entries

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Access AFHRA unit history files or Joe Baugher database
2. Obtain variant-specific aircraft inventory for November-December 1942
3. Re-attempt extraction with variant data
4. Target tier: **Tier 2** (review_recommended) or **Tier 1** (production_ready) with complete data

## NOTES

- The 319th BG was the FIRST Martin B-26 Marauder group in the Mediterranean Theater
- Extremely difficult deployment: Lost group CO en route, only 17 of 57 aircraft arrived
- High operational tempo from day one (first mission 17 days after arrival)
- Lost two group-level commanders in first month of operations
- Shared critical supply situation with 310th BG (only 13 aircraft operational between both groups)
- Unit historically significant but operationally challenged in Q4 1942
- Excellent candidate for extraction once variant data obtained
