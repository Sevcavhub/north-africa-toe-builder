# Orphaned Units Report

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Issue**: WORKFLOW_STATE contains 90 completed units that are NOT in the current seed file

## Summary

- **Total completed files**: 153 (in `data/output/units/`)
- **Units matching current scope**: 63
- **Units NOT in current scope**: 90 (orphaned)
- **Current project scope**: 213 units
- **REAL progress**: 63/213 = **29.6%** (not 71.8%!)

## The Problem

At some point, the `projects/north_africa_seed_units.json` file was modified to change which units are in scope. However:

1. The completed unit files still exist in `data/output/units/`
2. WORKFLOW_STATE.json still lists these units as "completed"
3. These units don't count towards the current 213-unit project goal

## 90 Orphaned Units

These units exist as completed files but are NOT in the current seed file:

### British Units (65 orphaned)
- british_1940-Q2_4th_indian_infantry_division
- british_1940-Q3_4th_indian_infantry_division
- british_1940-Q4_4th_indian_infantry_division
- british_1941-Q1_1st_south_african_infantry_division
- british_1941-Q1_4th_indian_infantry_division
- british_1941-Q1_5th_indian_infantry_division
- british_1941-Q1_7th_armoured_division_the_desert_rats
- british_1941-Q2_1st_south_african_infantry_division
- british_1941-Q2_4th_indian_infantry_division
- british_1941-Q2_50th_northumbrian_infantry_division
- ... and 55 more

### Italian Units (13 orphaned)
- italian_1940-Q2_ariete_armored_division
- italian_1940-Q2_bologna_infantry_division
- italian_1940-Q2_brescia_infantry_division
- ... and 10 more

### German Units (8 orphaned)
- german_1941-Q1_deutsches_afrikakorps
- ... and 7 more

### French Units (4 orphaned)
- All 4 French units are orphaned

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Clean Up (Recommended if scope was intentionally reduced)
1. Move orphaned files to archive
2. Update WORKFLOW_STATE.json to remove orphaned entries
3. Update PROJECT_SCOPE.md with correct 63/213 progress

### Option 2: Restore Scope (If units were accidentally removed)
1. Add the 90 units back to seed file
2. Update total scope to 303 units (213 + 90)
3. Update PROJECT_SCOPE.md to reflect 153/303 = 50.5% progress

### Option 3: Keep As-Is (For reference)
1. Leave orphaned files in place for reference
2. Document clearly that they're not part of current scope
3. Update PROJECT_SCOPE.md to show actual 63/213 progress

## Impact on Architecture v4.0

The autonomous orchestrator skip-completed logic is working CORRECTLY:
- It filters out the 63 units that match the current scope
- It leaves 150 units to process (213 - 63 = 150)
- This is the expected behavior

## Next Steps

User needs to decide:
1. Were these 90 units intentionally removed from scope?
2. Should we archive them or restore them to the seed file?
3. How should PROJECT_SCOPE.md reflect the real progress?
