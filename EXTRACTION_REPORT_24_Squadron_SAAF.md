## Hybrid Validation Results

### Wikipedia Identification: SUCCESS

Wikipedia successfully identified:
- Unit designation and formation date (5 March 1941)
- Aircraft type progression (Maryland → Boston III)
- Parent wing (No. 3 S.A. Wing SAAF)
- Major operations (El Alamein, Boston Shuttle Service)
- Base locations (LG.99, Soluch)

### Tier 1/2 Corroboration: FAILED

**Reason:** Could not access Tier 1/2 sources directly.

**Tier 1 Sources Identified but Not Accessed:**
1. Christopher Shores - Mediterranean Air War Vol. 2 (referenced in multiple sources, but book not accessed)
2. UK National Archives AIR 27 (catalogue entry found, but records not accessed)

**Tier 2 Sources:** None identified or accessed.

**Result:** <60% Tier 1/2 content → TIER 4 classification required

---

## Research Requirements

### To Achieve Tier 2 (60-74% complete)

**Required Actions:**
1. Purchase/access Christopher Shores - "Mediterranean Air War Vol. 2"
   - Expected data: Operational sorties, combat records, monthly summaries
   - Cost: ~$80-100 USD OR library access
   - Time: 2-4 weeks delivery

2. Request UK National Archives AIR 27 excerpts for Q4 1942
   - Expected data: Squadron commander, personnel, daily operations
   - Cost: £10-30 document order fees
   - Time: 2-6 weeks OR in-person visit

**Expected Result:** 60-70% completeness, sufficient for "review_recommended" status

### To Achieve Tier 1 (75-100% complete)

**Required Actions:**
1. Complete analysis of Christopher Shores Vol. 2
2. Full UK National Archives AIR 27 review (all Q4 1942 entries)
3. SAAF Museum records for organizational data
4. Air Britain journals for aircraft serial numbers
5. Cross-reference with No. 3 Wing SAAF records

**Expected Result:** 80-95% completeness, "production_ready" status

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Document this extraction as Tier 4 baseline**
   - JSON and chapter files created
   - Research requirements documented
   - Source access paths identified

2. **Prioritize Tier 1 source acquisition**
   - Christopher Shores Vol. 2 (highest priority - covers Q4 1942 operations)
   - UK National Archives AIR 27 (second priority - official squadron records)

3. **Plan re-extraction workflow**
   - Once Tier 1 sources acquired, re-extract with authoritative data
   - Target Tier 2+ classification (60%+ completeness)

### Long-Term Research Strategy

1. **Build SAAF source library**
   - Acquire Christopher Shores Mediterranean Air War series (Vols 1-4)
   - Establish relationship with SAAF Museum for research requests
   - Access Air Britain journals for Commonwealth squadron details

2. **Systematic archive access**
   - Plan UK National Archives visit for batch AIR 27 access (multiple SAAF squadrons)
   - Request digital copies for squadrons where physical visit not feasible

3. **Cross-unit analysis**
   - Extract No. 12 Squadron SAAF (Maryland, same wing)
   - Extract No. 21 Squadron SAAF (Baltimore, same wing)
   - Compare data for No. 3 Wing SAAF organizational understanding

## Conclusion

This extraction successfully **identified** No. 24 Squadron SAAF and established basic operational context for Q4 1942, but **did not achieve** the 60% Tier 1/2 source threshold required for production-ready data.

**Status:** TIER 4 - Research Brief Created

**Next Steps:**
1. Acquire Christopher Shores - Mediterranean Air War Vol. 2
2. Request UK National Archives AIR 27 records for Q4 1942
3. Re-extract with Tier 1/2 sources to achieve Tier 2+ classification

**Usefulness:** This research brief provides a solid foundation for future research and documents exactly what sources are needed. The unit is positively identified with confirmed aircraft type, parent wing, and operational context. However, operational details (sorties, losses, commanders) require Tier 1/2 source access.
