- Flexible employment of attached armor (typically 1-2 tank battalions)
- Advanced close air support coordination with USAAF

### Known Issues
- **Discipline Concerns:** Aggressive culture sometimes led to lapses in military discipline
- **Anti-Tank Deficiency:** 37mm AT guns inadequate against German Panzer IVs and Tigers
- **Supply Chain:** Desert logistics remained challenging

## Historical Legacy

The 1st Infantry Division's performance in Tunisia established it as one of the U.S. Army's elite formations. The division would go on to assault Sicily (July 1943), land at Omaha Beach on D-Day (June 1944), and fight through to Germany. The "Big Red One" earned a reputation for aggressive, effective combat leadership.

General Allen's controversial leadership style—effective in combat but problematic in garrison—led to his relief after Sicily. However, his legacy of decentralized leadership and tactical excellence remained embedded in the division's culture.
