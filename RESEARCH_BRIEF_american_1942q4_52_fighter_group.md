3. **USAAF Official Unit Histories**: Not accessed (AFHRA or NARA required)

### Wikipedia Usage (Identification Only) ✅
- Used for initial orientation only
- All extraction data from Tier 2 sources
- Protocol followed correctly

---

## Recommended Research Path

### Step 1: Locate Tier 1 Sources
1. Search project directory for WITW baseline data
2. Contact Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) for:
   - 52nd Fighter Group unit history
   - Monthly strength reports (Oct-Dec 1942)
   - Combat mission reports

### Step 2: Fill Priority 1 Gaps (Aircraft + Personnel)
1. AFHRA Archives: Monthly Status Reports
2. 12th Air Force organizational records
3. Squadron histories (2nd, 4th, 5th FS individual records)

### Step 3: Supplement with Priority 2 Data
1. Unit diaries (if available)
2. Personal accounts/memoirs from 52nd FG veterans
3. Published histories: "Spitfires and Yellow Tail Mustangs" by Tom Ivie and Paul Ludwig (book exists but not accessed)

### Step 4: Cross-Reference
1. Compare with 31st Fighter Group data (also flew Spitfire Mk V in same timeframe/location)
2. Use RAF unit data from same bases as baseline
3. Validate against known Spitfire production/delivery schedules

| supply | 0% | No data |
| operations_history | 30% | Operation Torch only, no details |
| metadata | 100% | Can be completed |

**Tier Thresholds**:
- Tier 1 (75-100%): NOT ACHIEVABLE with current sources
- Tier 2 (60-74%): NOT ACHIEVABLE with current sources
- Tier 3 (50-59%): BORDERLINE (need +10% more data)
- **Tier 4 (<50%)**: CURRENT STATUS ← Research brief appropriate

## Extraction Decision: REFUSED

**Reason**: Insufficient Tier 1/2 data to achieve minimum Tier 2 (60% complete) extraction.

**What Was Found**:
- ✅ 3+ key facts from Tier 2 sources (protocol met)
- ✅ Specific aircraft variants (Spitfire Mk Vb, Mk Vc)
- ✅ Operational dates and battles

**What Was Missing**:
- ❌ Aircraft counts
- ❌ Personnel numbers
- ❌ Supply data
- ❌ Detailed operations history
- ❌ Ordnance stocks
- ❌ Complete base information for entire Q4

**Next Steps**:
1. Archive research required (AFHRA, NARA)
2. Acquire published unit history (Ivie/Ludwig book)
3. Cross-reference with 31st FG data (parallel unit)
4. Re-attempt extraction when Priority 1 data obtained

---

## Notes for Future Extraction

### Known Constraints
- USAAF groups newly operational in theater (Nov 1942 = first month)
- Equipment borrowed from British stocks (complicates inventory tracking)
- Rapid operational tempo during Torch may mean incomplete record-keeping
- Ground echelon arrived separately (by sea), may affect personnel counts

### Useful Context
- 52nd FG later achieved fame with P-51 Mustangs (1944+)
- First USAAF aces in Spitfires came from this unit
- Parallel research on 31st Fighter Group recommended (same aircraft, same theater, same timeframe)

### WITW Export Implications
- Unit present in North Africa 1942-Q4 (Nov-Dec only)
- Likely WITW scenario: Operation Torch, Tunisia Campaign
- Need accurate aircraft counts for scenario balance
