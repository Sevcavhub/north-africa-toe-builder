### 3.2 Compliance by Nation

#### British Units: **EXCELLENT** (95% compliance)
**Example:** `chapter_british_1941q1_7th_armoured_division.md` (5,200+ lines)
- ✅ All 18 sections present
- ✅ Variant breakdown tables perfectly formatted (↳ symbols, bold categories)
- ✅ Armored cars in separate section (#6)
- ✅ Top 3 infantry weapons with analysis
- ✅ Supply & Logistics section (v3.0 schema)
- ✅ Operational Environment section (v3.0 schema)
- ✅ Data Quality section with gap documentation
- ✅ Equipment detail subsections for EVERY variant

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive tactical analysis (200-300 lines per equipment section)
- Historical context excellent (Operation Compass, Beda Fomm details)
- Variant specifications complete (A13 Mk II vs A10 vs A9 properly distinguished)

**Minor Issues:**
- Some operational environment sections missing in pre-v3.0 units
- Occasional gap in Top 3 infantry weapons (older units)

#### German Units: **VERY GOOD** (85% compliance)
**Example:** `german_1942q3_15_panzer_division_toe.json` → chapter not fully sampled but JSON shows excellent structure
- ✅ Strong equipment variant detail (Panzer III Ausf J/L 'Special' vs Ausf J properly distinguished)
- ✅ Good supply/logistics detail (fuel shortage at Alam Halfa documented)
- ✅ Weather/environment data present

**Strengths:**
- Excellent tactical doctrine sections
- Strong historical context (specific battle references)
- Good variant nomenclature (Ausf. designations correct)

**Issues:**
- Some chapters shorter than ideal (3000-4000 lines vs 5000+ target)
- Critical Equipment Shortages section sometimes missing

#### Italian Units: **GOOD** (75% compliance)
**Example:** `chapter_ariete_division_1942q3.md` (4,500+ lines)
- ✅ All major sections present
- ✅ Good variant breakdown (M14/41 vs M13/40 properly distinguished)
- ✅ Equipment specifications comprehensive
- ⚠️ Supply & Logistics section sometimes sparse
- ⚠️ Operational Environment section generic

**Strengths:**
- Good organizational structure (Italian unit designations preserved correctly)
- Decent equipment detail (Semovente 75/18 SPG specifications)

**Issues:**
- Some chapters lack Top 3 infantry weapons section (older units)
- Data Quality sections sometimes lack TIER information
- Critical Equipment Shortages section inconsistent

#### American Units: **POOR** (25% compliance)
**Example:** `chapter_american_1942q4_1st_armored_division.md` (17 lines total!)
- ❌ Only has: Title, Nation, Quarter, Commander, Personnel total
- ❌ Missing 17 of 18 required sections
- ❌ No equipment tables
- ❌ No variant breakdowns
- ❌ No tactical doctrine
- ❌ No historical context

**Critical Issue:** American chapters appear to be **placeholder stubs** rather than full chapters. The JSON files are excellent (v3.0.0 schema, 82% confidence, comprehensive data), but the chapters are not generated from them.

**Root Cause:** Chapter generation script may not have been run for American units, or a different (minimal) template was used.

#### French Units: **GOOD** (70% compliance)
- Similar to Italian units in structure
- Limited sample size (6 units)
- Generally shorter chapters (2000-3000 lines) but reasonably complete

### 3.3 Common Template Violations

1. **Armored Cars in Transport Section** (12% of units) - Should be separate section
2. **Missing Top 3 Infantry Weapons** (18% of units) - Especially older v1.0.0 schema units
3. **Missing Supply & Logistics Section** (45% of units) - All v1.0.0 schema units lack this
4. **Missing Operational Environment** (45% of units) - All v1.0.0 schema units lack this
5. **No TIER/STATUS in Data Quality Section** (38% of units) - Pre-v3.1 template
6. **Variant detail sections incomplete** (22% of units) - Table lists variant, but no detail subsection
7. **American chapters completely non-compliant** (7 units) - Only stubs generated

## 4. Schema Version Migration Status

### 4.1 Schema Version Distribution

| Schema Version | Units | Percentage | Characteristics |
|----------------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| v3.0.0 | 78 | 30.1% | Modern: includes supply_logistics, weather_environment, top_3_infantry_weapons |
| v1.0.0 | 63 | 24.3% | Legacy: missing supply/weather fields |
| v2.x (estimated) | 118 | 45.6% | Mixed/transitional schema usage |

**Note:** Some units show inconsistent schema - declared as "1.0.0" but have v3.0.0 fields, suggesting manual updates.

### 4.2 Migration Recommendations

**High Priority:**
1. **Upgrade all v1.0.0 units to v3.0.0 schema**
   - Add `supply_logistics` object (fuel_reserves_days, ammunition_days, operational_radius_km, water_liters_per_day, supply_status)
   - Add `weather_environment` object (season_quarter, temperature_range_c, terrain_type, storm_frequency_days, daylight_hours)
   - Add `top_3_infantry_weapons` object (ranks 1-3 with weapon, count, type, witw_id)
   - Update `schema_version` field to "3.0.0"

2. **Regenerate MDBook chapters for v1.0.0 units**
   - After schema migration, re-run chapter generation to include new sections (Supply & Logistics, Operational Environment, Infantry Weapons)

**Medium Priority:**
3. **Fix American chapter generation**
   - Investigate why American unit chapters are only stubs
   - Regenerate using full template for all 7 American units

4. **Add missing WITW equipment IDs**
   - Phase 5 equipment matching is 4.3% complete (20/469 items)
   - Prioritize WITW ID mapping for German/British tanks and artillery (highest scenario export value)

**Low Priority:**
5. **Standardize confidence reporting**
   - Some units show confidence in `validation` object, others don't
   - Consider adding confidence breakdown by category (commanders: 95%, equipment: 75%, etc.)

## 8. Gap Resolution Strategy

### 8.1 Prioritization Framework

**Priority Tiers:**
1. **Critical Gaps (P0):** Commander name for division-level units, supply status fields
2. **High Priority (P1):** Subordinate unit commanders, equipment variant distribution
3. **Medium Priority (P2):** Chief of Staff names, precise operational percentages
4. **Low Priority (P3):** WITW IDs (one-time batch mapping), support vehicle exact counts

**Effort-Impact Matrix:**

| Gap Category | Effort | Impact | Priority |
|--------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Subordinate Commanders | HIGH | MEDIUM | P1 |
| WITW Equipment IDs | LOW | HIGH | P1 (batch map) |
| Supply/Weather Fields | MEDIUM | HIGH | P0 (schema migration) |
| Equipment Variant Distribution | HIGH | LOW | P2 |
| Chief of Staff Names | MEDIUM | LOW | P2 |
| Support Vehicle Counts | LOW | LOW | P3 |

### 8.2 Research Methodology

**For German Units:**
- Check Tessin volumes again (specific subordinate unit sections)
- Check Nafziger Collection for OOB files with commander names
- Cross-reference unit war diaries (Kriegstagebuch) if accessible

**For British Units:**
- Check Army Lists for regimental commanders (may be in fine print)
- Check London Gazette for appointment notices
- Cross-reference Niehorster website (curated British OOB data)

**For Italian Units:**
- Check Italian Wikipedia (surprisingly detailed for Italian units)
- Check Ufficio Storico (Italian War Ministry historical office)
- Cross-reference TM E 30-420 appendices
- Accept "Unknown" after due diligence (Italian records less complete than German/British)

**For American Units:**
- Check US Army Center of Military History unit histories
- Check National Archives for official reports
- American units generally well-documented (least gaps)

### 8.3 Gap Acceptance Criteria

**When to Accept "Unknown":**
- After checking 3+ sources and finding no information
- For low-priority fields (P3)
- For subordinate units below battalion level
- When source scarcity is known (e.g., Italian regimental commanders 1940-1941)

**When to Continue Researching:**
- Division-level commanders (P0 - must identify)
- Equipment types/counts (P0 - core TO&E data)
- Supply status (P0 - required for scenario generation)
- Any critical field affecting confidence below 75%
