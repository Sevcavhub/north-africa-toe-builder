## Why More Units Than Expected?

The extraction process discovered **additional historical units** not in the original project scope:

1. **Subsidiary formations**: Independent brigades, corps-level units
2. **Commonwealth forces**: Polish, South African, Indian formations under British command
3. **Reorganizations**: Units that changed designation mid-quarter (e.g., Western Desert Force to XIII Corps)
4. **Attached units**: Independent tank regiments, artillery groups

**This is a POSITIVE outcome** - more comprehensive historical coverage than originally planned.

---

## Data Quality Summary

### Schema Compliance
- All units comply with Unified Schema v3.1.0
- All units have `organization_level` field (critical for Phase 6)
- All units follow canonical naming standard (lowercase nation, quarter format)
- Tank breakdown structure correct (heavy/medium/light/total)

### Confidence Levels
- **Average confidence**: 85%
- **Minimum confidence**: 75% (meets requirement)
- **Maximum confidence**: 95%

### Source Diversity
- **Tier 1 sources** (90%+ confidence): Tessin, British Army Lists, Nafziger Collection
- **Tier 2 sources** (75%+ confidence): Wikipedia, specialized military history sites
- **Multi-source verification**: All critical facts (commanders, dates, compositions) verified from 2+ sources

## Technical Verification

### Canonical Output Structure
All files stored in canonical locations (Architecture v4.0):
- Units: `data/output/units/`
- Chapters: `data/output/chapters/`
- No duplicate files in session directories

### File Naming Convention
All files follow standard format:
- JSON: `{nation}_{quarter}_{unit_designation}_toe.json`
- Chapters: `chapter_{nation}_{quarter}_{unit_designation}.md`

### Schema Fields Present
All units include:
- Top-level structure (no improper nesting)
- Supply/logistics section (fuel_reserves_days, ammo_days, operational_radius_km)
- Weather/environment section (season, temperature, terrain)
- Combat status section (readiness, morale, effectiveness)
- Command section (commander name, rank, appointment date)

## Next Phase Readiness

### Phase 6: Ground Forces Unit Extraction (IN PROGRESS)
- **Status**: 1941 extraction COMPLETE at 100%+
- **Next focus**: 1942-1943 quarters (283 units remaining)
- **Current overall**: 137/420 unit-quarters (32.6%)

### Phase 7: Air Forces (FUTURE)
- **Requirement**: Complete Phase 6 first (all 420 ground unit-quarters)
- **Scope**: 80-120 air force units (fighters, bombers, reconnaissance)
- **Status**: Not yet started (as per PROJECT_SCOPE.md phased approach)

### Phase 9: Scenario Generation (FUTURE)
- **Requirement**: Both Phase 6 (ground) and Phase 7 (air) complete
- **Scripts needed**: `scripts/generate_scenario_exports.js` (TO BE CREATED after equipment matching complete)
- **WITW integration**: Requires Phase 5 equipment matching (currently 4.3%, 20/469 items)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. COMPLETE - Verify all 4 final units present in canonical locations
2. COMPLETE - Confirm 1941 at 100% completion
3. NEXT - Begin 1942 extraction (currently 49 units, need 90+)

### Phase 6 Continuation
1. **Focus on 1942**: Extract remaining 1942 quarters to 100%
2. **Then 1943**: Complete final year of North Africa campaign
3. **Equipment matching**: Continue Phase 5 alongside extraction (currently 4.3%)

### Phase 9 Preparation
1. **Create enrichment scripts**: `scripts/enrich_units_with_database.js` (REQUIRED for scenarios)
2. **Create scenario export**: `scripts/generate_scenario_exports.js` (REQUIRED for WITW)
3. **Test WITW integration**: Verify equipment IDs map correctly

## Conclusion

**MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: All 1941 quarters achieved 100%+ completion. The 4 units referenced in the resume mission were already complete from previous sessions. VS Code crash did not result in any data loss.

**Current Status**: Phase 6 (Ground Forces) at 32.6% overall (137/420 unit-quarters). 1941 is fully complete and ready for Phase 9 scenario generation once equipment matching and enrichment scripts are ready.

**Next Focus**: 1942 extraction to continue Phase 6 progress toward 420 unit-quarters goal.
