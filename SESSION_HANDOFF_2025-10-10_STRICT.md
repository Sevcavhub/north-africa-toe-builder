**FROM SESSION**: MDBook Template Updates + QA System Implementation
**TO SESSION**: Continue Autonomous Extraction (195 units remaining)
**MODE**: AUTONOMOUS ONLY - NO MANUAL OPERATIONS

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU MUST OPERATE IN FULLY AUTONOMOUS MODE ONLY.**

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Do manual JSON entry
- ‚ùå Process units one-by-one manually
- ‚ùå Create prompt files for manual processing
- ‚ùå Ask user to copy/paste anything
- ‚ùå Generate "stub" or "template" data
- ‚ùå Deviate from template standards established below
- ‚ùå Skip any required sections
- ‚ùå Summarize equipment (ALL variants must be detailed)

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Use autonomous extraction system (`npm run start:autonomous`)
- ‚úÖ Process 3-5 units in parallel batches
- ‚úÖ Read source documents directly (MCP filesystem)
- ‚úÖ Write outputs autonomously (no manual saving)
- ‚úÖ Follow template v2.0 standards 100%
- ‚úÖ Validate every unit against QA checklist (below)
- ‚úÖ Stop and report if you cannot follow standards

---

## üéØ YOUR MISSION

**Continue autonomous extraction toward 213 total units**

**First Actions:**
1. **Check CURRENT_STATUS.md** for latest progress metrics
2. **Count completed units**: `ls data/output/autonomous_*/units/*.json | wc -l`
3. **Identify in-progress work**: Check for incomplete batches or pending validations
4. **Review GAP_TRACKER.md** for priority units (confidence < 80%)

**Your Task:**
1. Complete any in-progress batch work from previous session
2. Validate completed units against template v2.0 (use checklist below)
3. Continue extraction prioritizing:
   - Units with confidence < 80% (fill gaps first)
   - Italian units (typically lower confidence, need attention)
   - British/Commonwealth units (good source availability)
   - German units (excellent Tessin coverage)
   - American units (US Field Manuals available)
   - French units (mixed equipment challenges)
4. Run QA Auditor after every 10 units

**Success Criteria:**
1. Every unit follows template v2.0 (see checklist below)
2. No manual operations - fully autonomous
3. Batch processing (3-5 units parallel)
4. QA validation after every 10 units
5. All standards maintained (no drift)

### 4. Section 11 - Data Quality & Known Gaps (REQUIRED)

**EVERY chapter MUST include this section.**

**Format:**

```markdown
## Data Quality & Known Gaps

**Confidence Score**: 85% (High confidence - Tier 1 local sources + Tier 2 curated web sources)

### Data Sources

This unit's TO&E was compiled from:
- **Primary Sources**: British Army Lists 1940-Q2, War Establishment documents, British Armoured Formations 1940-1941 by organization historians
- **Secondary Sources**: Desert Rats history website (Feldgrau equivalent for British), British Military History database
- **Cross-Referenced**: 4 sources consulted, commander verified from 3 sources, tank totals from 2 independent sources

### Known Data Gaps

The following information could not be confirmed from available sources:

**Important Gaps** (affect core TO&E understanding):
- 7th Armoured Brigade commander name not confirmed (brigade level commander appointment not in available Army Lists)
- Exact distribution of A9 vs A10 cruisers in 6th Royal Tank Regiment (total cruisers known, but variant split uncertain)

**Moderate Gaps** (refinements needed):
- Precise strength numbers for some regiments (estimates based on establishment, not actual returns)

**Low Priority** (supplementary data):
- WITW game IDs not available for most British vehicles (wargaming reference only, not historical)

### Research Notes

**Verified Facts**:
- Commander O'Moore Creagh confirmed from three sources: British Army Lists 1940, War Diaries, and regimental histories
- Tank totals (166 total, 69 cruisers, 97 light tanks) verified from British Armoured Formations 1940 and 7th Armoured Division war diary
- 7th Support Group composition confirmed from British armoured formations doctrine and divisional organization tables

**Methodology**:
- Used Tier 1 sources (local Army Lists) for command structure
- Cross-referenced equipment counts with Tier 2 web sources
- No Wikipedia used for primary facts (only for general context)
- Confidence reduced 10% for unconfirmed brigade commander name

### Gap Resolution Priority

- üî¥ **High Priority**: 7th Armoured Brigade commander research (need Q2 1940 brigade appointment records)
- üü° **Medium Priority**: A9 vs A10 distribution (need 6th RTR war diary or regimental history)
- üü¢ **Low Priority**: WITW ID cross-reference (defer to Phase 8 wargaming integration)

### Future Improvements

When additional sources become available, the following areas would benefit from refinement:
1. Brigade commander appointments for 4th and 7th Armoured Brigades
2. Exact cruiser tank variant distribution by regiment
3. Precise regimental strength returns vs establishment numbers
```

**If you cannot create this section with real data, you MUST note what gaps exist. DO NOT skip this section.**

---

## üöÄ AUTONOMOUS EXTRACTION WORKFLOW

**Follow this EXACT workflow for each batch:**

### Step 1: Initialize Batch (3-5 units)

```bash
npm run start:autonomous
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Loads project configuration
- Identifies next 3-5 units to process
- Searches source documents (3-tier waterfall)
- Extracts relevant source material

**If this fails:** Report error and STOP. Do not proceed manually.

---

### Step 2: For Each Unit - Autonomous Processing

**The system will automatically:**
1. Read source documents (Tessin, Army Lists, Field Manuals)
2. Extract facts from sources
3. Generate unit JSON file (unified_toe_schema.json v1.0.0)
4. Generate MDBook chapter (MDBOOK_CHAPTER_TEMPLATE.md v2.0)
5. Write files to `data/output/autonomous_*/units/` and `north_africa_book/src/`

**You DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Manually create JSON
- ‚ùå Manually write chapters
- ‚ùå Copy/paste anything for user
- ‚ùå Create "template" files for user to fill in

**book_chapter_generator agent has been updated** to automatically enforce template v2.0 standards. Trust the agent.

---

### Step 3: Quality Validation (AFTER each unit)

**Run validation checklist (above) on each unit:**

1. Open generated MDBook chapter
2. Verify ALL sections present (13 sections)
3. Check EVERY equipment section:
   - Summary table with bold categories, ‚Ü≥ variants ‚úì
   - Detail section for EVERY variant ‚úì
   - Armored cars separate (not in transport) ‚úì
   - No tanks/armored cars in transport ‚úì
4. Verify Section 11 (Data Quality) present ‚úì
5. Open JSON file
6. Verify confidence ‚â• 75% ‚úì
7. Verify validation.known_gaps populated ‚úì
8. Cross-check: JSON equipment counts = Chapter equipment counts ‚úì

**IF ANY VALIDATION FAILS:**
- STOP processing next unit
- Regenerate failed unit
- Re-run validation
- Only proceed when validation passes

---

### Step 4: Batch Complete - QA Audit

**After every 10 units (or end of session):**

1. Run QA Auditor:
```bash
node src/agent_runner.js qa_auditor
```

2. Review outputs:
   - `GAP_TRACKER.md` updated
   - `QUALITY_REPORT.json` generated
   - `COMPLIANCE_REPORT.json` generated
   - `PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md` updated

3. Check metrics:
   - Average confidence ‚â• 80% ‚úì
   - No critical gaps ‚úì
   - Template compliance 100% ‚úì

4. If metrics fail: STOP and fix issues before continuing

---

## üéØ UNIT PROCESSING PRIORITY

**Process in this order:**

### Batch 1-3: Italian Units (HIGH PRIORITY - Below 80%)
1. Bologna Division (1940-Q4) - 77% confidence ‚Üê NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
2. Brescia Division (1940-Q3) - 78% confidence ‚Üê NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
3. Trieste Division (1941-Q1) - 79% confidence ‚Üê NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
4-10. Additional Italian units from project config

**Goal:** Bring ALL Italian units above 80% confidence

### Batch 4-10: British/Commonwealth Units
- Focus on 1940-1941 quarters
- Include India, Australia, NZ, Canada, South Africa formations
- High source availability (British Army Lists)

### Batch 11-15: German Units
- 1941-1942 quarters
- Excellent Tessin coverage
- Panzer divisions first, then infantry

### Batch 16-20: American Units
- 1942-1943 quarters
