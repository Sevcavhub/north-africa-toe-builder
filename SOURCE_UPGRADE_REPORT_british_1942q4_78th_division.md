## Known Gaps Documentation (Enhanced)

The upgrade process has IMPROVED gap documentation by tying each gap to specific primary source limitations:

### 1. Chief of Staff Name
**Gap**: Name unknown for 1942 Q4
**Primary Sources Checked**:
- IWM LBY 99/392 (artillery perspective, limited HQ staff detail)
- British Military History database
- niehorster.org OOB
- Playfair official history

**Confidence Impact**: -3 percentage points
**Mitigation**: UK National Archives WO 169/8318 (78th Division war diary) or divisional headquarters records

### 2. Brigade Commanders (11th and 36th)

**Primary Sources Checked**:
- IWM war diary (artillery perspective, limited brigade command detail)

- Playfair official history

**Confidence Impact**: -4 percentage points
**Mitigation**: Brigade war diaries at UK National Archives or regimental histories for constituent battalions

### 3. Equipment Allocations
**Gap**: Specific equipment counts for 78th Division not documented
**Status**: Estimated from War Office War Establishment 1942
**Primary Sources Checked**:

- British Military History database (operational deployment only)
- niehorster.org (confirms organization but not equipment counts)

**Confidence Impact**: -6 percentage points
