## üìù Recommendations for Future Research

### High Priority:
1. **Access USAAF unit history files** at National Archives (if available)
2. **Request 57th Fighter Group records** from Air Force Historical Research Agency
3. **Search IX Fighter Command reports** for operational summaries
4. **Locate Christopher Shores books** for Mediterranean air operations detail

### Medium Priority:
5. Search USAAF personnel records for squadron commanders
6. Review USAAF aircraft assignment cards for serial numbers
7. Check USAAF supply reports for logistics data
8. Find individual pilot memoirs or interviews

### Low Priority:
9. Cross-reference with RAF/Commonwealth unit diaries (for attached operations)
10. Review post-war unit histories and veteran associations
11. Search newspaper archives for contemporary accounts
